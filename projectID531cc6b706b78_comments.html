<HTML><BODY>This small monograph on the Kachari people of Assam is wonderfully illustrated with four coloured plates, and a number of photographs.

<p>There are numerous accented letters, including letters with underdots, rings above, breves, macrons, etc. Every other chapter seems to use a different mode of writing the Kachari language, so please don't look for too much consistency.

<p>I've marked this project as hard, due to a number of bilingual pages in the text. Some of these contain parallel translations, with one line showing the original Kachari, and the line below the literal English translation. To facilitate the HTML-ization of this, please (during the F-rounds) handle those as follows:

<p>Place each group of words between brackets, and place the matching English after a bar, within the brackets of the matching phrase above, for example, the well known French song we would handle as follows:

<pre>
[Frère Jacques,|Brother Jacob,] [frère Jacques,|brother Jacob,]
[Dormez-vous ?|Are you sleeping?] [Dormez-vous ?|Are you sleeping?]
[Sonnez les matines !|Ring the Matins bells!] [Sonnez les matines !|Ring the Matins bells!]
[Ding, daing, dong.|Ding, dang, dong.] [Ding, daing, dong.|Ding, dang, dong.]
</pre>

<p>The few words in Assamese (in Bengali script) can be marked as [**Assamese], and I will handle them myself (the Latin transcription is always preceding those.)
