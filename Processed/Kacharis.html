<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is with some diffidence that I comply with Colonel
Gurdon&rsquo;s request that I should add a few words of preface and
explanation to the last literary work of an old friend and pastor,
whose loss will long be lamented in the Assam Valley, where he laboured
as a missionary and planter&rsquo;s chaplain for upwards of forty
years. Mr. Endle&rsquo;s interest in his Kach&aacute;ri flock was that
of an evangelist rather than that of a linguist or ethnologist, and
this preoccupation has coloured his style and affected the matter of
his book in a way that, however pleasant and natural it may seem to
those who had the privilege of his acquaintance, may perhaps require a
few words of explanation for the benefit of those who look for
anthropology only, or linguistics, in his pages.</p>
<p>My first duty, then, is to say a few words about the author&rsquo;s
life and character. Sidney Endle was born about 1840 at Totnes in
Devon, of sturdy yeoman parentage. His grandfather was, it seems, proud
of being an armiger, and it is a family tradition that many Endles
figured in the ranks of the Catholic clergy of the West country. Mr.
Endle was educated at Totnes Grammar School, under the Rev. James
Powney, and early conceived a wish to enter the ministry of the Church
of England, and serve abroad as a missionary. With this view he entered
St. Augustine&rsquo;s College at Canterbury. Unfortunately the College
seems to have kept no written record of the dates at which one of the
most distinguished and devoted of its pupils entered and left its roof.
It was in February, 1864, however, that he was sent by the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel to Tezpur, in Assam, to be the assistant
of Mr. Hesselmyer, then in charge of the Kach&aacute;ri mission at that
place. In 1865 he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e466" href="#xd26e466" name=
"xd26e466">xii</a>]</span>Calcutta, and in the following year he was
admitted to priest&rsquo;s orders. Soon after he was transferred to the
independent charge of the S.P.G. mission among the tea-garden coolies
at Dibrugarh in Upper Assam. In 1869, on Mr. Hesselmyer&rsquo;s death,
Mr. Endle was made chaplain of the important tea-planting district of
Darrang, with the charge of the Kach&aacute;ri mission in that
district, having his head-quarters at Tezpur. His pastoral duties were
thus two-fold. On the one hand, he became the pastor of an European
community scattered over an area some 100 miles in length by 30 or 40
in breadth. It was his duty to gather his flock round him at some
convenient tea-garden, or at the pretty little rustic church at Tezpur
itself, where his congregation included the small band of officials. He
was everywhere welcome, and it was not long before he was as popular as
he was respected. One of the most unworldly and simple of men, almost
an ascetic in his personal tastes and habits, he could sympathise with
and understand men whose training and ideas were different from his. He
had a native shrewdness and quiet sense of humour which stood him in
good stead in his dealings with men probably as varied in their origins
and temperament as are to be found in any collection of Englishmen
beyond the seas. His sermons&mdash;and he could preach with equal ease
and eloquence in English, Assamese, and Kach&aacute;ri&mdash;were ever
those of a man who to shrewd observation of the various life about him,
native and European, added an unwavering devotion to the
responsibilities of his calling. Authoritative, and even stern, he
could be when he thought it needful to assert his responsibility as a
priest. But, somehow, the occasion rarely occurred, since his was not
the disposition that demands impossible perfection of ordinary human
nature. There was no touch of intolerance in his gentle and (there is
no other word to describe him) saintly nature. I think he would have
liked to have it said of him that, like Chaucer&rsquo;s Parson,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He was a shepherd and no mercenerie,</p>
<p class="line">And though he holy were and vertuous,</p>
<p class="line">He was to simple men not dispitous,</p>
<p class="line">Ne of his speech dangerous ne digne,</p>
<p class="line">But in his teaching discrete and benigne.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e479" href="#xd26e479" name=

<p>Innumerable were the marriages and christenings he celebrated in all
parts of Assam, and it was characteristic of the man that he regarded
it as a duty to keep himself informed of the welfare, spiritual and
physical, of the children he held at the font. During his rare visits
to England he endeavoured when he was not busy preaching for his
mission, to visit those whom in their infancy he had admitted to his
Church. Few chaplains in India can have been so universally popular and
respected as he was, and this without in any way relaxing from the
dignity which, in his case, belonged rather to his sacred office than
to any consideration for his own person.</p>
<p>But he made no secret of the fact that his heart was chiefly in his
missionary work among his beloved Kach&aacute;ris. The Bodos of the
Kach&aacute;ri <i>dwars</i> (the <i>dwars</i> or &ldquo;doors&rdquo; of
the Kach&aacute;ri plains are the passes that lead into the rough
mountains of independent Bhutan) are, like most of the aboriginal races
of Assam, cheery, good-natured, semi-savage folk; candid, simple,
trustful, but incorrigibly disrespectful according to Indian notions of
good manners. To a casual observer, they may well have seemed incapable
of comprehending the gentle reserve and unaffected unselfishness of
their pastor&rsquo;s nature. Among them, however, it was his delight to
unbend, and give way to the almost boyish simplicity and sense of fun
which to the last were among his most engaging traits. When Mr. Endle
approached a Kach&aacute;ri village during one of the prolonged
preaching tours which were to him at once a duty and the keenest of
pleasures, he was always greeted with a joyous and often noisy welcome.
He travelled on foot, and the villagers would turn out to see the
<i>g&#257;mi-n&#299;-brai</i>, the &ldquo;old man of the
village,&rdquo; as they affectionately called him. He was often
cordially invited to share in the village festivities, and it was an
interesting sight to watch him seated in the midst of rough semi-savage
folk, listening to the tale of their simple joys and sorrows, enjoying
their primitive jokes, and, when occasion served, talking to them, as
probably no one else will ever be able to talk to them again, of the
matters nearest to the missionary&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>In all parts of the Kach&aacute;ri country, Mr. Endle established
many village schools, served by trusty converts. But his chief
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e495" href="#xd26e495" name=
"xd26e495">xiv</a>]</span>pride was in the church he built at Bengbari,
which, to his great joy, was consecrated by Bishop Milman in person.
Under its thatched roof has now been placed a tablet to the memory of
its founder.</p>
<p>No account of Mr. Endle&rsquo;s life, however brief, would be
complete without a mention of the fact that in 1875 he married Miss
Sarah Ewbank Chambers, who for twenty years shared his pastoral
anxieties. Mrs. Endle was much respected by the European community
throughout Assam, and her sudden death in Calcutta in 1895 was
universally regretted. How sorely her husband felt her loss, not even
those who knew him best were allowed to guess, but it was plain that,
from this time onwards, much of his old elasticity of mind and body
deserted him, and though he continued his work with unabated industry
the effects of age began for the first time to be apparent to his
friends. In 1884 Mr. Endle compiled his well-known manual of the
Kach&aacute;ri language, published by the Assam Secretariat Press. From
time to time he contributed papers on the subject of the Bodo people to
the <i>Transactions</i> of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1891 he
was elected an Honorary Fellow of St. Augustine&rsquo;s College, in
recognition of his linguistic studies and of his eminence as a worker
in the mission field. In 1906 he was offered a canonry by the Bishop of
Calcutta, but characteristically refused a dignity which might have
involved absences from his missionary duties.</p>
<p>Such, briefly told, are the few outstanding events in a life wholly
devoted to pastoral work, of which little was known outside his native
flock. It was Mr. Endle&rsquo;s repeatedly expressed wish that he might
end his life and be laid to rest among his Kach&aacute;ris. This wish
was not fulfilled. Towards the end of 1905 it was evident that his
persistent disregard of his personal comfort in an enervating climate
had taxed a naturally robust constitution. He was induced with some
difficulty to pay a brief visit to England for rest and change. He
spent this holiday chiefly in preaching for his mission and visiting
old friends. He was soon, perhaps too soon, back at his work. It could
no longer be hidden from himself or others that he had overtaxed his
strength. This, however, caused him no disquietude. He had done his
day&rsquo;s work, and was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e504" href=
"#xd26e504" name="xd26e504">xv</a>]</span>cheerfully ready to take his
departure. In July 1907, he could struggle no longer against growing
weakness, and was placed on one of the little mail steamers that ply up
and down the Brahmaputra, in the hope that river breezes, rest, and
change of scene might bring about some restoration to health. He
himself, however, knew that his end was near, and he passed away,
painlessly and peacefully, on the river bank at Dibrugarh, close to the
scene of his first independent missionary charge, entrusted to him more
than forty years before.</p>
<p>So much by way of biographical introduction seemed necessary, not
only as an inadequate and too brief memorial of a singularly unselfish
and blameless career, but also as an explanation of some features in
Mr. Endle&rsquo;s book not usually found in anthropological manuals. Of
the subject of the book itself I may now be allowed to say a few words,
if only to show that it has an interest and importance, from an
ethnological point of view, which are perhaps disguised by the
author&rsquo;s characteristically modest estimate of his task and of
his power of dealing with it. The book is, primarily, a monograph
treating of that branch of the Kach&aacute;ri race which lives in
scattered hamlets along the foot-hills of the Himalayas in Northern
Bengal and Assam, intermixed now with Hindu people who have intruded
into what was once their undisputed home. In Assam proper the Hindus
call them Kach&aacute;ris; in Bengal they are known as Meches.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e508src" href="#xd26e508" name="xd26e508src">1</a>
Their own name for their race is Bo&#7771;o or Bo&#7693;o (the o has
the sound of the English o in &ldquo;hot&rdquo;). Among this northern
branch of the race is embedded the tribe of the Koch, whose name is
pronounced locally as if it were Koss, (to rhyme with our English
&ldquo;boss&rdquo;). (Kach&aacute;ri, I may mention in passing, is also
pronounced as Koss-&#257;ri.) The Koch have gradually become a
semi-Hindu caste, most of whose members now talk the Indian Bengali or
Assamese. It also contains the surviving remnants of the royal family
of the great and powerful Koch empire, which, roughly, covered the same
area as the present province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It can be
proved that the aboriginal members of the Koch caste within quite
recent times spoke the Bo&#7771;o language. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e511" href="#xd26e511" name=
"xd26e511">xvi</a>]</span>In the East of the Assam Valley was another
powerful kingdom, that of the Chutiyas, whose language was another
branch of the speech described in this book. The river names of the
whole Brahmaputra Valley are Bo&#7693;o names, and it is demonstrable
that the Bo&#7693;os were the aborigines of the Valley. In the great
mass of hills, an outlying spur of the mountains of Upper Burma, which
divide the Brahmaputra Valley from that of the river Surma which runs
parallel to it from east to west are two more Bo&#7693;o groups. The
most eastern of these comprises the Di-m&#257;-s&#257;,
Great-River-Folk (di- means &ldquo;river&rdquo; or
&ldquo;water,&rdquo;) people who were driven out of the valley of the
great river Brahmaputra in historical times, and finally became rulers
of what is now the great tea-planting district of Cachar or
K&#257;ch&#257;r. They either gave its name to or perhaps derived their
Hindu soubriquet of Kach&#257;ri from this district. Of this branch of
the race an interesting description will be found in the supplement to
this book. At the western extremity of the range of hills is another
group, the Garos, of whom an excellent account has lately been
published by Major A. Playfair, I.A. (London, David Nutt, 1909). The
Garos are of peculiar interest as members of the Bo&#7693;o family,
because they were head-hunters within the memory of men still
living.</p>
<p>Finally in the range of hills in the south of the Surma Valley,
there are the Tipperahs whose language is obviously a branch of the
ancient Bo&#7693;o speech; quiet inoffensive people, ruled over by a
semi-independent Raja who is also a great land-owner in the British
districts of Tipperah and Sylhet.</p>
<p>Now, the anthropologists rightly caution us against rashly
concluding that a common speech, where races are in contact, implies a
common origin, since everywhere, and especially among people who use an
unwritten language, nothing is more common than the borrowing of a
neighbouring tongue. But where, as here, we have five absolutely
separate communities of semi-savage people, who nowadays are not so
much as aware of one another&rsquo;s existence, and yet speak what is
to all purposes the same language, it is plain that they must have been
united at no very distant date by some common social bond. The date
cannot have been very distant, because in the unwritten speech of
semi-savage people phonetic decay acts very rapidly, and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e518" href="#xd26e518" name=
"xd26e518">xvii</a>]</span>very few years may serve to disguise the
relationships of adjacent and cognate tongues. No one who has heard
members of the five branches of the Bo&#7693;o race speak their
respective languages can fail to recognise that they belong to the same
linguistic group. Moreover, this common Bo&#7693;o speech was, till
within a few years ago, the language of the Koches, the dominant and
ruling tribe in the great Koch kingdom, which survived, with something
of its ancient prestige and power, long enough to be visited by an
Englishman, Ralph Fitch, in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time. It would
seem, then, that the language spoken in the ancient Koch kingdom, which
extended from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, was the Koch or
Bo&#7693;o language, and the mass of the people must have been of
Bo&#7693;o origin. In the Brahmaputra valley these Bo&#7693;os have
survived in the midst of Hindu and Shan invaders and settlers, of whom
those who are interested in the subject may read in Mr. E. A.
Gait&rsquo;s admirable <i>History of Assam</i>, (Calcutta, Thacker,
Spink and Co., 1906). Here the anthropologist may come to the rescue of
the historian. The Bo&#7693;o type of face and physical construction
is, as Mr. Endle says, of an Indo-Chinese kind, easily distinguishable
from the Arya-Dravidian type common in adjacent Bengal, and careful
measurements in the Brahmaputra and Surma Valleys ought to show how far
the old Koch element still persists, how far it has been obliterated by
inter-marriage with Indian immigrants.</p>
<p>It may, however, be assumed that the population of the Koch kingdom,
and therefore of its predecessor, the famous classical empire of
K&#257;ma-r&#363;pa, of which Sanskrit scholars may read in the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata (perhaps in a late interpolation in the epic) was
chiefly Bo&#7693;o, of the same type as the humble folk who are the
subject of Mr. Endle&rsquo;s book. K&#257;ma-r&#363;pa was visited in
the first half of the seventh century of our era by the famous Chinese
traveller Hiuen Tsiang, whose interesting account of the land and
people may be found at page 22 of Mr. Gait&rsquo;s <i>History</i>.
&ldquo;They adore and sacrifice,&rdquo; says the Chinese explorer,
&ldquo;to the Devas and have no faith in Buddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was apparently in the kingdom of K&#257;ma-r&#363;pa that there
came into being that form of Hinduism whose scriptures are the later
Pur&#257;&#7751;as and the Tantras, the worship of &#346;iva and his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e530" href="#xd26e530" name=
"xd26e530">xviii</a>]</span>Sakti, that form of the Hindu cult which,
to this day and even in the temple of K&#257;li-gh&#257;&#7789; in
Calcutta itself, is distinguished by sacrifice by decapitation. In the
earlier times of British rule, as readers of Mr. Gait&rsquo;s book may
find for themselves, the Hindus of Assam were much addicted to human
sacrifice by beheading, and, to this day, the appropriate method of
propitiating the terrible goddess K&#257;li, the &ldquo;dark one&rdquo;
(who is also Dur-g&#257;, &ldquo;hard of approach&rdquo;), is by bloody
sacrifices. The &#346;aiva or &#346;&#257;kt&#257; form of Hinduism
would therefore seem to be due to an engrafting of Koch superstitions
on the purer and humaner religious ideas imported into India by the
Aryan settlers to whom we owe the Vedas and the religious literature
based on those early pastoral hymns. From this point of view, it is
important to bear in mind that the Garos were till lately headhunters,
and that the Chutiyas were conspicuous, even in North-Eastern India,
for their addiction to human sacrifices.</p>
<p>How does it happen then, it may be asked, that the Bo&#7693;os
described in this book are among the most innocent and kindly of
semi-savage people? The answer seems to be that the bulk of the
inhabitants of North-Eastern India were always simple inoffensive folk,
and that it was only the ruling tribes and families that were addicted
to war, rapine, torture, cruelty, and the religious developments that
go with these. If Assam is undoubtedly still the home of the Tantrik
beliefs which have their centre at the famous shrine of
K&#257;m&#257;k&#7779;&#257; at the old capital of the Koch monarchs
(now known as Gu&#257;-h&#257;&#7789;i or Gauhati), Assam is also the
home of the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-ite reform, an attractive and learned
account of which will be found in a paper by Sir Charles N. E. Eliot,
published in the &ldquo;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&rdquo; for
October, 1910. The common people in Assam, the rustic Hindus of the
Brahmaputra Valley, are in temperament and habits very like the
cheerful and smiling Bo&#7693;o folk among whom Mr. Endle laboured, and
of whom he writes with such frank regard and appreciation. The climate
of the valley is enervating and soft, and any traveller in Assam can
see for himself how the once fierce and warlike Ahom invaders, who gave
its name to the country of Assam, have become as soft and kindly in
disposition as the Kach&aacute;ris themselves. No more remarkable
instance of the effect of environment on national <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e534" href="#xd26e534" name=
"xd26e534">xix</a>]</span>temperament could be found anywhere, and the
anthropological theories of Dr. Ridgeway could hardly have a more
remarkable support than he might find by contrasting the semi-savage
inhabitants of the Brahmaputra Valley with the bloodthirsty and warlike
tribes in the surrounding mountains, their neighbours and
relatives.</p>
<p>I have only to say, finally, that I have added, as an Appendix to my
old friend&rsquo;s book, a literal interlinear translation of three
stories from my little Collection of Kach&aacute;ri Folk-tales. In
adding these I have followed the example set by Sir Charles Lyall in
his monograph on the <a class="pglink xd26e52" title=
"Link to Project Gutenberg ebook" href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48706">Mikirs</a>. By means of this
interlinear and word-for-word translation, the comparative linguist may
see for himself how far Kach&aacute;ri is still a monosyllabic
agglutinative language, and how far it has borrowed the inflectional
mechanism of Assamese and Bengali. There has, of course, been mutual
borrowing, and I, for one, do not doubt that the syntactical
peculiarities of Assamese are largely due to the fact that it is a
speech with an Aryan vocabulary spoken by a people who are largely
non-Aryan. Any careful reader of the stories in this book can see for
himself that the Bo&#7693;o spoken in the Kach&aacute;ri <i>dwars</i>
is the language of a biglot people. Their picturesque agglutinative
verb is plainly a survival of days when the language was as
monosyllabic as Chinese. But the general structure of the language is
now governed by inflections obviously borrowed from Bengali and
Assamese.</p>

Origin, Distribution and Historic Summary, etc.</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Characteristics.</span> I. 1.
The people generally known to us as &ldquo;Kach&aacute;ris&rdquo;
differ in some material ways from their Hindu and Musulm&aacute;n
neighbours alike in things material and moral. They are certainly not a
tall or handsome race, and in general appearance bear some resemblance
to the Nep&aacute;li, being as a rule shorter and stouter than the
people of North-west India, though well fitted to bear up against
physical fatigue and hardship. <span class=
"marginnote">Physical</span>In face and figure they show a distinct
approximation to what is known as the Mongolian type, <i>i.e.</i>, they
have square set faces, projecting cheek-bones, with almond-shaped eyes,
and scanty beard and moustache, the last-mentioned being often wanting
altogether. In this way they are well fitted for all forms of outdoor
(field and factory) labour that require strength rather than skill, and
may very reasonably be regarded as the &ldquo;navvies&rdquo; of
Assam.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Mental.</span> 2. In mental and
intellectual power they are undoubtedly far below their Hindu
neighbours; for they possess neither the quickness of apprehension, nor
the astonishing power of memory, &amp;c., characteristic of the higher
castes among the Hindus. On the other hand, what they do succeed in
mastering, often with much toil and painful effort, they digest and
retain with much tenacity. Among other social and mental features of
character there are two which are seldom wanting to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>&ldquo;Kach&aacute;ri&rdquo;: (1) he is an intensely
clannish being. A fine imposed on one member of a village community is
sometimes paid by the whole body of villagers together. When employed
in any considerable numbers on a tea factory, the Kach&aacute;ri
labourers so employed, resenting some real or fancied wrong done to
<i>one</i> of their number, will often leave the garden in a body, even
though there may be a month&rsquo;s pay due to every one of them. Again
they have (2) no small share of that quality so powerful for good or
evil, according as it is guided into right or wrong channels,
<i>i.e.</i>, a certain strength of will, &ldquo;what their friends
might call firmness, and their enemies might term obstinacy.&rdquo; If
they once make up their minds, and they are abundantly capable of doing
this, to act in a certain way, it is mere waste of time to attempt to
reason them out of their resolution, for nothing short of absolute and
overpowering physical force is of any avail to turn them from the
course they have once for all resolved to adopt and act upon.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Moral.</span> 3. As regards the moral
character of the Kach&aacute;ri race, those who know them best will be
the first to speak favourably of them. Like many of the Sub-Himalayan
hill tribes, they undoubtedly have a certain weakness for what may be
looked upon as their national beverage (<i>Madh</i>, <i>zu</i>), a form
of rice-beer. Of this, in itself a comparatively harmless liquor when
taken in moderation, they at times consume very large quantities,
especially at weddings, funerals, and at the January and April
<i>Bihu</i> festivals; and more particularly at what is known as the
&ldquo;first eating of the new rice&rdquo; (<i>Now&aacute;n bh&aacute;t
khoa</i>; <i>Mikham g&#259;d&agrave;n z&aacute;nai</i>), which usually
takes place about the middle of December or a little earlier. At this
last-mentioned gathering the writer has sometimes seen well-nigh the
entire population of a Kach&aacute;ri village <i>hors de combat</i>
from the effect of over-indulgence in the national beverage. But they
are certainly not habitual drunkards, and in this matter
Kach&aacute;ris as a rule would compare not unfavourably with the
working man in more civilised lands; <i>e.g.</i>, in England. But apart
from this particular failing, one almost universal among hill tribes on
this frontier, it is pleasing to be able to say that among them are to
be found many simple virtues of great price, <i>i.e.</i>, honesty,
truthfulness, straightforwardness and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>general trustworthiness
deserving of all honour. In illustration of their simple truthfulness,
even when involving serious consequences to themselves, the writer
recalls a story told him some years ago by an officer in charge of the
subdivision of Mangaldai, the late A. J. Primrose, I.C.S. A
Kach&aacute;ri of Sekh&aacute;r Mauza was brought before this
magistrate on a charge (manslaughter) involving a very heavy penalty,
when he without hesitation admitted his guilt, though the evidence
against him was of the slightest, or at least utterly insufficient to
secure a conviction. The relations of the sexes too are on the whole of
a very sound and wholesome character, far more so probably than in many
countries boasting of a higher civilisation. Infant marriage is as yet
unknown among them, and so far as the present writer has been able to
ascertain during the past forty years, the young people are as a rule
chaste before marriage and true to their marriage vows in after-life.
But it must be clearly understood that all this holds good of the
Kach&aacute;ri in his simple, patriarchal, village life, and there
only. His innocence is the innocence of ignorance, not the innocence of
experience: and he is as a rule free from certain forms of evil because
in his village life he has never come under any temptation to indulge
in them. When contaminated by civilization, <i>e.g.</i>, when brought
into contact with our civil and criminal courts, much of this innocence
must inevitably disappear; and of this sad deterioration of character
any man who has been long in the country, and learnt to know the people
well, must have experienced many melancholy and painful
illustrations.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin, &amp;c.</span> II. The origin of
the Kach&aacute;ri race is still very largely a matter of conjecture
and inference, in the absence of anything entitled to be regarded as
authentic history. As remarked above, in feature and general appearance
they approximate very closely to the Mongolian type; and this would
seem to point to Tibet and China as the original home of the race. The
Garos, a race obviously near of kin to the Kach&aacute;ris, have a
tradition that in the dim and distant past their forefathers,
<i>i.e.</i>, nine headmen, the offspring of a Hindu <i>fakir</i> and a
Tibetan woman, came down from the northern mountains, and, after a halt
at Koch-Behar, made their way to Jogighopa, and thence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>across the
Brahmaputra to Dalgoma, and so finally into the Garo Hills. It is not
easy to say what degree of value is to be attached to this tradition,
but it does at least suggest a line of inquiry that might well be
followed up with advantage.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e635src" href=
"#xd26e635" name="xd26e635src">1</a></p>
<p>It is possible that there were at least two great immigrations from
the north and north-east into the rich valley of the Brahmaputra,
<i>i.e.</i>, one entering North-east Bengal and Western Assam through
the valley of the Tista, Dharla, Sankosh, &amp;c., and founding there
what was formerly the powerful kingdom of K&#257;m&#257;r&#363;pa; and
the other making its way through the Subansiri, Dibong and Dihong
valleys into Eastern Assam, where a branch of the widespread
Kach&aacute;ri race, known as Chutiy&aacute;s, undoubtedly held sway
for a lengthened period. The capital quarters of this last-mentioned
people (the Chutiy&aacute;s) was at or near the modern Sadiya, not far
from which certain ruins of much interest, including a copper-roofed
temple (<i>T&aacute;m&aacute;r ghar</i>), are still to be seen. It is
indeed not at all unlikely that the people known to us as
Kach&aacute;ris and to themselves as Ba&#7693;a (Bara), were in earlier
days the dominant race in Assam; and as such they would seem to have
left traces of this domination in the nomenclature of some of the
physical features of the country, <i>e.g.</i>, the Kach&aacute;ri word
for water (<i>di</i>; <i>d&#335;i</i>) apparently forms the first
syllable of the names of many of the chief rivers of the province, such
as Diput&aacute;, Dihong, Dibong, Dibru, Dihing, Dimu, Des&aacute;ng,
Diku (<i>cf.</i> khu Tista), &amp;c., and to these may be added
Dikrang, Diphu, Dig&aacute;ru, &amp;c., all near Sadiya, the earliest
known centre of Chutiy&aacute; (Kach&aacute;ri) power and
civilisation.</p>

<p class="first"><i>From a Photograph by Mr. T. E. Emerson.</i></p>
</div>
<p><span class="marginnote">Distribution.</span> III. But however this
may be, there would seem to be good reason for believing that the
Kach&aacute;ri (Ba&#7693;a) race is a much more widely distributed one
than it was at one time supposed to be. They are undoubtedly found well
outside the limits of modern (political) Assam, <i>i.e.</i>, in
North-east Bengal Koch-Behar, &amp;c., and also in Hill Tippera, where
the language of the people gives decisive evidence that they are of the
Ba&#7693;a stock. But apart from these outlying members of the race,
there are within the limits of Assam itself at least 1,000,000
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>souls, probably many more, who belong to the
Kach&aacute;ri race; though many of the number have of late years
become more or less Hinduised, and have lost the use of their mother
tongue. These may perhaps be conveniently divided into a (1) Northern
and (2) a Southern group, the Brahmaputra being taken roughly as the
dividing line, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>To these may be added one or two smaller communities, <i>e.g.</i>,
the Mor&aacute;ns and the Chutiy&aacute;s in Upper Assam, whose
language, not altogether extinct as yet though apparently dying out
rapidly, would seem to prove them to be closely akin to the
Kach&aacute;ri (Ba&#7693;a) race.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Historic Sketch.</span> IV. The only branch
of this widely spread race that may be said to have anything like an
authentic history is that settled in what is known as the once powerful
kingdom of K&#257;m&#257;r&#363;pa (Koch), the reigning family of which
is now represented by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>Rajas of Koch-Behar, Bijni, Darrang
(Mangaldai) and Beltola. But on the history of this (the Western)
section of the Kach&aacute;ri race there is no need to dwell, as it was
very effectively dealt with some few years ago.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e849src" href="#xd26e849" name="xd26e849src">2</a> But the
earliest historical notices of the Eastern branch of the race show that
under the name of Chutiy&aacute;s they had established a powerful
kingdom in the Eastern corner of the Province, the seat of Government
being at or near the modern Sadiya. How long this kingdom existed it is
now impossible to say; but what is known with some degree of certainty
is, that they were engaged in a prolonged struggle with the Ahoms, a
section of the great Shan (Tai) race, who crossed the P&aacute;tkoi
Hills from the South and East about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1228,
and at once subdued the Mor&aacute;ns, Bor&aacute;his, and other
Kach&aacute;ri tribes living near the Northern slope of these hills.
With the Chutiy&aacute;s the strife would seem to have been a long and
bitter one, lasting for some 150 or 200 years. But in the end the
victory remained with the Ahoms, who drove their opponents to take
refuge in or about <span class="corr" id="xd26e855" title=
"Source: Dimapur">Dim&aacute;pur</span> on the Dhansiri at the foot of
the Naga Hills. There for a time the fugitives were in comparative
security and they appear to have attained to a certain measure of
material civilisation, a state of things to which some interesting
remains of buildings (never as yet properly explored) seem to bear
direct and lasting witness. Eventually, however, their ancient foes
followed them up to their new capital, and about the middle of the
sixteenth century the Ahoms succeeded in capturing and sacking
Dim&aacute;pur itself. The Kach&aacute;ri Raja thereupon removed his
court to M&aacute;ibong (&ldquo;much paddy&rdquo;), where the dynasty
would seem to have maintained itself for some two centuries. Finally,
however, under pressure of an attack by the Jaintia Raja the
Kach&aacute;ri sovereign withdrew from <span class="corr" id="xd26e858"
title="Source: Maibong">M&aacute;ibong</span> to Kh&aacute;spur in
Kachar (<i>circa</i> 1750 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>). There they
seem to have come more and more under Hindu influence, until about 1790
the Raja of that period, Krishna Chandra, and his brother Govinda
Chandra made a public profession of Brahminism. They were both placed
for a time inside the body of a large copper image of a cow, and on
emerging thence were declared by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>Brahmins to be Hindus of the
Kshatriya caste, Bh&#299;ma of Mah&#257;bh&#257;rat fame being assigned
to them as a mythological ancestor. Hence to this day the Darrang
Kach&aacute;ris sometimes speak of themselves as
&ldquo;Bh&#299;m-n&#299;-fs&#257;,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> children of
Bh&#299;m, though as a rule they seem to attach little or no value to
this highly imaginative ancestry.</p>
<p>The reign of the last Kach&aacute;ri king, Govind Chandra, was
little better than one continuous flight from place to place through
the constant attacks of the Burmese, who finally compelled the unhappy
monarch to take refuge in the adjoining British district of Sylhet. He
was, indeed, reinstated in power by the aid of the East India
Company&rsquo;s troops in 1826, but was murdered some four years later,
when his kingdom became part of the British dominions. His
commander-in-chief, one Tul&aacute; R&aacute;m, was allowed to remain
in possession of a portion of the subdivision now known as North
Cachar, a region shown in old maps of Assam as &ldquo;Tula Ram
Senapati&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; But on the death of this chieftain in
1854, this remaining portion of the old Kach&aacute;ri Raj was formally
annexed to the district of Nowgong.</p>
<p>As regards this last-mentioned migration, <i>i.e.</i>, from Maibong
to Kh&aacute;spur about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1750, and the
conversion to Hinduism which soon followed it, it would seem that the
movement was only a very limited and restricted one, confined indeed
very largely to the Raja and the members of his court. The great
majority of his people remained in the hill country, where to this day
they retain their language, religion, customs, &amp;c., to a great
extent intact. It is not improbable, indeed, that this statement may
hold good of the earlier migrations also, <i>i.e.</i>, those that
resulted from the prolonged struggle between the Ahoms and the
Chutiy&aacute;s. When as a result of that struggle the defeated race
withdrew first to Dim&aacute;pur and afterwards to M&aacute;ibong, it
is not unlikely that the great body of the Chutiy&aacute;s
(Kach&aacute;ris) which remained in the rich valley of Assam came to
terms with their conquerors (the Ahoms) and gradually became
amalgamated with them, much as Saxons, Danes, Normans, &amp;c., slowly
but surely became fused into one nationality in the centuries following
the battle of Hastings. In this way it may well be that the
Kach&aacute;ri race were the original autochthones <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>of Assam,
and that even now, though largely Hinduised, they still form a large,
perhaps the main, constituent element in the permanent population of
the Province. To this day one often comes across villages bearing the
name of &ldquo;Kach&aacute;rigaon,&rdquo; the inhabitants of which are
completely Hinduised, though for some considerable time they would seem
to have retained their Kach&aacute;ri customs, &amp;c., unimpaired. It
may be that, whilst the great body of the Chutiy&aacute;
(Kach&aacute;ri) race submitted to their Ahom conquerors, the stronger
and more patriotic spirits among them, influenced perhaps by that
intense clannishness which is so marked a feature in the Kach&aacute;ri
character, withdrew to less favoured parts of the Province, where their
conquerors did not care at once to follow them up; <i>i.e.</i>, the
Southern section of the race may have made its way into the districts
known as the Garo Hills and North Cachar; whilst the Northern section
perhaps took up its abode in a broad belt of country at the foot of the
Bhutan Hills, still known as the &ldquo;Kach&aacute;ri Duars,&rdquo; a
region which, being virtually &ldquo;Terai&rdquo; land, had in earlier
days a very unenviable reputation on the score of its recognised
unhealthiness. And if this view of the matter be at all a sound one,
what is known to have happened in our own island may perhaps furnish a
somewhat interesting &ldquo;historic parallel.&rdquo; When about the
middle of the fifth century the Romans finally withdrew from Britain,
we know that successive swarms of invaders, Jutes, Danes, Saxons,
Angles, &amp;c., from the countries adjoining the North and Baltic
seas, gradually overran and occupied the richer lowland of what is now
England, driving all who remained alive of the aboriginal Britons to
take refuge in the less favoured parts of the country, <i>i.e.</i>, the
mountains of Wales and the highlands of Scotland, where many of the
people of this day retain their ancient mother speech: very much as the
Kach&aacute;ris of Assam still cling to their national customs, speech,
religion, &amp;c., in those outlying parts of the Province known in
modern times as the Garo Hills, North Cachar and the Kach&aacute;ri
Duars of North-west Assam.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Final Separation of Northern and
Southern</span> V. It may perhaps be asked how a people so clannish and
united as the Kach&aacute;ris are well known to be, should ever become
so widely separated as the Western (Bara) and Southern
(Dim&aacute;s&aacute;) sections now undoubtedly are. The separation
would seem to be almost final and complete. The writer, <i>e.g.</i>,
has often tried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span><span class="marginnote">Sections of the
race.</span> to ascertain if the Kach&aacute;ris of the Northern Duars
retained any tradition of ever having been subject to the Raja of
Dim&aacute;pur; but up to the present time no trace of any such
tradition has come to light. Intermarriage between the two sections of
the race is apparently quite unknown; indeed, the barrier of language
would of itself probably go far to prevent such intermarriage: for
although the two languages have much in common, yet in their modern
form they differ from each other nearly as much as Italian does from
Spanish; and members of the two sections of the race meeting each other
for the first time would almost certainly fail to understand each
other&rsquo;s speech. Perhaps the following tradition,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e906src" href="#xd26e906" name="xd26e906src">3</a>
which apparently describes one of the closing scenes in the prolonged
struggle between the Chutiy&aacute; Kach&aacute;ris and the Ahoms, may
go some way to account for the wide separation between the Northern and
Southern sections of the race. The story is as follows:&mdash;Long,
long ago the Dim&aacute;s&aacute; fought against a very powerful tribe
(the Ahoms), and being beaten in a great pitched battle, the king with
all his forces retreated. But presently further retreat was barred by a
wide and deep river, which could in no way be crossed. The Raja, being
thus stopped by a river in front and an enemy behind, resolved to fight
once more the next day, unless the problem of crossing the river could
be solved. With this determination he went to sleep and had a dream in
which a god appeared to him and promised to help him. The god said that
early next morning the king with all his people must boldly enter the
river at a spot where he would see a heron standing in the water, and
walk straight across the river, but no one must look back. Next morning
a heron was found, sure enough, standing in the water near the bank;
and the king, remembering his dream, led his people to the spot and
went into the water, which they found had shoaled enough to form a ford
and allow them to wade across. In this way he crossed with a great part
of his people. But still all had not crossed. There were some on the
other bank and some in the middle of the river, when a man among the
latter wondering whether his son was following him, looked back, with
the result that the water at once got deep and every one had to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>save himself as best he could; while the men on
the other bank, having no chance of crossing, dispersed. They who were
caught in the middle of the river had to swim for their lives, and were
washed down to different places. Some saved themselves by catching hold
of <i>Kh&aacute;gris</i> (rushes) growing on the bank, and are to this
day called <i>Kh&aacute;gr&aacute;b&aacute;ria</i>. Others caught hold
of <i>nals</i> (or reeds) and are thus called Nalb&aacute;rias. The
Dim&aacute;s&aacute; are the people who crossed in safety.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious that the Oriental love for the grotesquely
marvellous has had no small share in the development of this tradition;
but whilst making all due allowance for this, the writer ventures to
think that the tradition itself is not altogether without a certain
historic value. It probably represents the closing scenes in the
protracted struggle for supremacy between the Ahoms and the
Chutiy&aacute;s (Kach&aacute;ris) when the latter, finally beaten,
endeavoured to escape their foes by crossing the Brahmaputra to the
South bank, using for that purpose whatever material was at hand,
<i>e.g.</i>, rude dug-out boats (<i>khel n&aacute;u</i>), extemporised
rafts (<i>bhel</i>), &amp;c. The student of Assam history will remember
that a like mishap befell Mir Jumla&rsquo;s expedition for the conquest
of Assam; Rangpur, Ghergaon, &amp;c., when a violent storm or sudden
rise in the river carried away or sunk the boats containing his
ammunition and other stores, and he was compelled to come to terms with
the Ahom rulers. A sudden storm or rapid rise in the river may have
prevented many of the fugitives from crossing, and these would perforce
have fallen into the hands of the Ahoms. The latter, acting on the
principle &ldquo;Divide et impera,&rdquo; may have forced their
captives to take up their abode in the unhealthy (Terai) country now
known as the &ldquo;Kach&aacute;ri Du&aacute;rs,&rdquo; and further may
have prohibited any communication between the two severed fragments of
the conquered race, which would thenceforth naturally drift further
asunder, until the separation became as complete as it remains to this
day.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Dwellings, houses,
&amp;c.</span> In their domestic life, the Kach&aacute;ris of this
district (Darrang) do not differ very materially from their Hindu
neighbours, to the subordinate castes of whom they are no doubt very
closely allied. The houses are of the usual type, one-storied only, the
walls being of <i>ekr&aacute;</i> reed or of split bamboo, and the roof
of thatch fastened by cane. Each hut commonly contains two rooms, one
for eating, &amp;c., and the other for sleeping. There is no trace here
of the practice which prevails among some tribes of the Province who
are undoubtedly very nearly related to the Kach&aacute;ris,
<i>i.e.</i>, the provision of bachelor-barracks
(<i>Dek&aacute;ch&aacute;ngs</i>), where all the young unmarried men of
the village have to sleep apart from the dwellings of settled
householders. It is probable, indeed, that this custom formerly
obtained here, but all trace of it seems to have passed away long
since.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Villages.</span> A Kach&aacute;ri village
is as a rule much more compact than a Hindu one, the houses being built
more closely together. Usually, too, there is comparatively little
foliage in the way of trees, &amp;c.; and occasionally even something
like a street separates the two or more lines of houses which compose a
village. One prominent feature in the typical Kach&aacute;ri village
cannot fail to strike the attention of any casual visitor at first
sight. Each house, with its granary and other outbuildings, is
surrounded by a ditch and fence, the latter usually made of
<i>ekr&aacute;</i> reeds, jungle grass or split bamboo, &amp;c. The
ditch, some three or four feet in depth, surrounds the whole homestead,
the earth taken from it being thrown up on the inner side, <i>i.e.</i>,
that nearest to the dwelling-house; and on the earthworks, some two or
three feet in height, so thrown up are firmly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>inserted
the reeds or split-bamboo work forming the fence itself, this latter
often inclining outwards at a very obtuse angle; so that the ditch and
fence are not easily surmounted from the outside by would-be intruders.
A Kach&aacute;ri village usually abounds in domestic live-stock of
various kinds, <i>e.g.</i>, ducks, fowls, goats, pigs, cattle, &amp;c.;
and it can hardly be doubted that the fence and ditch above spoken of
are largely intended to prevent the cattle, pigs, &amp;c., from getting
into the rice-fields at night, and so doing serious damage to the paddy
and other crops. With the abundance of live-stock, especially hogs,
reared and kept by the Kach&aacute;ris, it need hardly be said that the
villages can scarcely be described as being cleanly; though as a rule
they do not differ so much as might be supposed in this respect from
their Hindu neighbours, separate buildings being provided for the pigs,
goats, &amp;c., at an appreciable distance from the family
dwelling-house.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Furniture, Implements and
Utensils</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Little need be said under this head, as the equipment
of the Kach&aacute;ri householder for dealing with domestic or field
work is almost identical with that of his Hindu neighbours. But it may
be stated that in a Kach&aacute;ri house there will usually be found an
exceptionally large number of earthenware vessels (pottery, &amp;c.)
which are used freely and frequently in the preparation and
distribution of the much-prized rice-beer (<i>Zu</i>).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Occupation, crops, &amp;c.</span>
Agriculture is still the great industry of the Kach&aacute;ris of this
district, both the hot weather (<i>&aacute;us</i>) and the cold season
(<i>s&aacute;li</i>) varieties of rice being largely cultivated,
especially the latter. In carrying out this work the people show both
application and skill, so much so, that, failing some very overwhelming
convulsion of Nature, it would seem to be hardly possible that a famine
could take place in the Kach&aacute;ri Duars. This part of the district
is abundantly supplied with water by the numerous streams issuing from
the lower spurs of the Bhutan Hills, streams which for the most part
flow in very shallow beds, and therefore admit of being easily used for
irrigation purposes, whenever the seasonal rainfall may be at all
scanty. Moreover, the people are especially skilful in the construction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>of irrigation canals and earthwork embankments for
diverting water from river-beds into their rice-fields: and their
efforts in this direction are very largely aided by their closely
clannish organisation. Whenever the rainfall threatens to be below the
average, the village headman with his associated elders fixes on the
spot whence water is to brought from the nearest river to the
rice-fields. At this spot very rude and primitive shelters of jungle
grass, &amp;c., are put up: and here all the manhood strength of the
village, each man armed with hoe, dao, &amp;c., are compelled to take
up their abode until the necessary work has been fully carried out. In
this way it will be obvious that the Kach&aacute;ris have a highly
efficient and very inexpensive &ldquo;Public Works Department&rdquo; of
their own; and vigorous efforts of self-help of this character would
seem to be worthy of high commendation and hearty support.</p>
<p>But it is not only in constructing embankments and irrigation
canals, &amp;c., that the people work together in this way. Very much
the same plan is adopted in carrying out other enterprises in the
success of which all are alike interested, <i>e.g.</i>, in harvesting
the great cold weather rice-crop in December and January each year.
When this important work is in full swing, it is but rarely that the
owner of a rice-field is found cutting his paddy alone and
single-handed. He summons his neighbours to come and help him in this
work&mdash;a summons which usually meets with a ready and cheerful
response. It is quite common to see in December and January organised
bodies of labourers, varying in number from ten to fifty or more, all
in line and busy with the sickle in one man&rsquo;s field at the same
time. Every man as a rule works for the time being at high pressure,
his toil being lightened by much merry talk and laughter, and many
jests and jokes&mdash;these last, it must be admitted, not always of a
highly refined character. There is a pleasing absence of the mercenary
element in the whole transaction; for as a rule no money payments
whatever are made to the workers. On the other hand, the wife of the
proprietor of the rice-field is almost always present in person, and
busies herself in keeping ever ready an abundant supply of wholesome
and highly appetising cooked food, to be eaten on the spot, the nearest
grove of plantain trees providing ready-made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>plates
and dishes. Her post is no sinecure, as the hungry reapers make very
frequent raids on the good things she provides; and she has above all
to be careful to see that the much prized rice-beer (<i>Zu</i>) shall
be at all times forthcoming in unstinted quantity. Her lord and master
is usually content to wield a sickle with the reapers, like Boaz of
old; and, of course, he holds himself ready to lend a hand in the same
unpaid fashion in carrying out his neighbours&rsquo; harvesting
operations, whenever his services in this direction may be called for.
This whole system of mutual help in time of pressure is a marked
feature of Kach&aacute;ri social and domestic life, and tends in no
small degree to develop and strengthen that clannish temperament of
which it may be considered to be in some sense the natural outcome.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Crops, &amp;c.</span> Rice, roughly
classified as the larger and the smaller grains (<i>maim&aacute;</i>
and <i>mais&aacute;</i>), is here, as elsewhere, the chief object of
the peasant&rsquo;s skill and labour; but other crops are not wanting,
<i>e.g.</i>, pulse, gathered in December, cotton, sugar-cane in limited
quantities, tobacco, &amp;c. Of this last-mentioned article there are
two distinct varieties commonly grown, <i>i.e.</i>, country tobacco and
Burmese<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1019src" href="#xd26e1019" name=
"xd26e1019src">1</a> (<i>M&aacute;n</i>) tobacco, the latter commanding
the higher price in the market. All surplus produce finds a ready sale
among the ever-growing numbers of imported labourers on tea estates,
many of whom are consumers of Kach&aacute;ri rice-beer or less harmless
liquors, and who in consequence fraternise readily with their
Kach&aacute;ri neighbours. In this way the average Bodo peasant is a
very well-to-do person in worldly things, the more so because the
Kach&aacute;ri labourer is in great demand as a factory worker. Where
there are three or four brothers in a family in Western Assam, it is
quite usual for one, perhaps two, of the number to remain at home to
cultivate the paternal acres, whilst the other brothers make their way
to tea estates in Upper Assam for the manufacturing season, often doing
double tasks day after day, and returning to the family fold in the
autumn with a large and liberal supply of lightly earned rupees at each
man&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Food, &amp;c.</span> As regards his food,
the Kach&aacute;ri is as a rule by no means limited and restricted,
like his Hindu and Musulm&aacute;n neighbours. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>On the
contrary, he enjoys and practises a freedom in this respect which no
doubt goes far to account for his often magnificent physique. With the
exception of beef he denies himself almost nothing. His great delicacy
is pork; and a Kach&aacute;ri village usually swarms with pigs in
almost every possible stage of growth. These animals are often exposed
for sale at fairs and markets in the Kach&aacute;ri country. There is,
however, one common article of food, which no orthodox old-fashioned
Kach&aacute;ri will ever touch, <i>i.e.</i>, milk. When questioned as
to the ground of his objection to milk as an article of food, he
usually says that he is unwilling to deprive the calf of its natural
support, though the real reason is probably of another
character.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1038src" href="#xd26e1038" name=
"xd26e1038src">2</a> This prejudice against the use of milk would now,
however, seem to be passing away; and some of the Kach&aacute;ri lads
attending the writer&rsquo;s Training Class at Tezpur now partake
freely of this natural and sustaining food.</p>
<p>Among other delicacies of the Kach&aacute;ri is what is known as
dried fish (<i>n&#257; gr&#257;n</i>),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1046src" href="#xd26e1046" name="xd26e1046src">3</a> <i>i.e.</i>,
the very small fish left on the surface of inundated land after the
water has subsided. This is collected in large quantities near the
banks of the Brahmaputra, and carried northwards to the Kach&aacute;ri
Duars, where it is exchanged for rice and silk (<i>eri</i>), &amp;c.
This small fish is not cured or prepared in any way, but simply dried
in the sun; and is very far from being attractive to the eye or the
nose, especially to the latter. Nevertheless, it is greatly prized by
the Kach&aacute;ri peasant as a welcome and savoury addition to his
somewhat monotonous daily fare; nor does the free use of this hardly
inviting article of food seem to be attended by any very injurious
results to the physical well-being of those who largely and liberally
use it.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Hunting, fishing.</span> The Kach&aacute;ri
often varies his diet by adding to it the proceeds of the chase and by
fishing in the numerous shallow hill-streams in which his country
abounds. Deer and wild pigs are frequently caught, sometimes by the use
of large nets, enclosing a considerable extent of grass land in which
some keen eye has detected the presence of the much-prized game.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>The net is gradually contracted until the prey
comes within the reach of some stout Kach&aacute;ri arm, when blows
from club or <i>dao</i> speedily bring its career to a close. In this,
as in almost all else, the Kach&aacute;ri is clannish and gregarious in
what he does; and regular hunting parties are duly organised to carry
out the work in hand. Much the same system is observed in conducting
fishing operations, though here the leading part is commonly taken by
the women. On certain prearranged dates, the women of a village,
sometimes of a group of villages, will fish a certain stream, or a
number of streams, for a distance extending over several miles. The
fishing implements used are of a very simple character, and are
commonly prepared from materials found in almost every village. Nets
are but rarely employed, as the water in these hill-streams is in the
cold weather, <i>i.e.</i>, the fishing season, usually very shallow,
rarely exceeding two or three feet in depth. The implements commonly
used are mainly two, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) the <i>zakh&aacute;i</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1081src" href="#xd26e1081" name="xd26e1081src">4</a>
and (2) the <i>p&#257;lh&#257;</i>, the former being employed chiefly,
but not exclusively, by women; and the latter by men. Both implements
are made of split bamboo work fastened together with cane. The
<i>zakh&aacute;i</i> is a triangular basket, open at one end, the three
triangular sides closing to a point at the other. The whole is attached
to a bamboo handle some three or four feet in length. Grasping this
handle firmly, the holder enters the river, usually only two or three
feet deep, and lowers the basket to the bottom, keeping the open end in
front of her person; and then making a splashing with her feet, she
endeavours to drive her prey into the open mouth of the basket, which
is then quickly lifted and its contents rapidly transferred to the
fish-basket. The system seems to be a very simple and even a clumsy
one, but is far from being wholly ineffective. Armed with this
<i>zakh&aacute;i</i>, a number of women, sufficient to extend across
the entire width of the stream, enter the river together, whilst
another party commence operations fifty or a hundred yards away. The
two parties work steadily towards each other, so that such fish as are
not caught <i>en route</i> are gradually driven into an ever-narrowing
stretch of water: and as a rule not many fish would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>seem to
escape. The whole scene is a very merry one, accompanied with much
laughter and pleasing excitement; and more particularly, as the two
parties of fish-catchers approach each other, and the fish make frantic
efforts to escape their doom, the fun becomes fast and furious. A
fish-catching expedition of this kind is invariably looked upon as a
village holiday, the entire population not infrequently taking an
active part in it.</p>
<div class="figure p016width" id="p016"><img src="images/p016.jpg" alt=
"KACHARI GIRL FISHING" width="512" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">KACHARI GIRL FISHING</p>
</div>
<p>A second popular method of catching fish is the use of the
<i>p&#257;lh&#257;</i>, which is not very unlike an ordinary circular
hen-coop. It is made of split bamboo fastened together by cane-work,
and is about 4 or 4&frac12; feet in height and about 3 feet in diameter
at the base. The upper portion is drawn somewhat closely together,
leaving an open space at the top sufficient to allow the admission of a
man&rsquo;s hand, the whole structure being quite light and easily
manipulated by one hand. Armed with this, the fisherman quietly enters
the shallow water at any likely spot, and whenever his quick eye
detects the presence of prey, the <i>p&#257;lh&#257;</i> is at once
placed over it, the lower surface of the basket-work closely clutching
the ground, and the fish so enclosed are then withdrawn by the hand
through the opening in the upper part of the instrument. This too, like
the <i>zakh&aacute;i</i>, seems a very primitive, unsuitable
contrivance, but in the hands of men trained to its use from earliest
childhood it is quite capable of being made to bring about very useful
results.</p>
<p>A third instrument used by Kach&aacute;ris in fish-catching is a
small, pointed, metallic spearhead attached to a light bamboo. This is
thrust rapidly and firmly into soft mud or other like places where
eels, &amp;c., are supposed to be concealed; and the fisherman
occasionally succeeds in transfixing and drawing out one or more of
these, which form a welcome addition to his daily diet.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Rice-beer (<i>Zu</i>), its preparation,
&amp;c.</span> In common with many other non-Aryan tribes on this
frontier, <i>e.g.</i>, the N&aacute;g&aacute;s, &amp;c., the
Kach&aacute;ris of Darrang habitually consume large quantities of what
is usually known as rice-beer (<i>Zu</i>, <i>Z&aacute;u</i>). It can
hardly be said to be a beverage in daily use, for it is only prepared
when specially wanted for immediate consumption. An essential
ingredient in the preparation of this most popular form of refreshment
is the condiment known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span>as <i>em&aacute;o</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1141src" href="#xd26e1141" name="xd26e1141src">5</a> which is
usually composed of at least three, and sometimes four, distinct
elements. To a definite proportion of husked rice is added (1) the
jack-tree leaf and (2) that of the jungle plant known as <i>bhetai</i>,
and in some cases the poison-fern, though this last-mentioned does not
seem to be really necessary. All these ingredients are vigorously
pounded together into a powder, which is then passed through a very
fine sieve, at least once and sometimes twice. The powder so prepared
is then mixed with water so as to make a more or less tenacious paste,
and this again is divided into portions sufficient to form solid discs,
about three inches in diameter, and one inch thick in the centre, with
thin edges. These discs are sprinkled freely with powder from similar
discs of some weeks standing, and are for a short time kept covered up
in rice-straw. They are then placed on a bamboo platform inside the
house for some four days, and are afterwards exposed freely to the hot
sun for another four or five days, so as to become thoroughly dry.
Finally they find their way into an earthenware water-vessel, which is
kept suspended at a distance of several feet over the fireplace though
they would seem to need no direct exposure to the action of fire-heat;
and here they remain until required for use.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, rice-beer is not used as a daily beverage, but
is prepared as required, especially for use at marriages, funerals,
harvest homes and other occasions that break the monotony of village
life. A common method of preparation is as follows:&mdash;A quantity of
selected rice, about 3 or 4 seers, is carefully boiled in an iron or
brass cooking vessel, the contents of which are then spread out on a
bamboo mat and allowed to become cold. Two cakes of the
<i>em&aacute;o</i> described above are then broken up into powder,
which is carefully mixed with the boiled rice; and the whole is then
stored in a thoroughly dry earthenware vessel (<i>kalas</i>). This
vessel with its contents is then placed upon a platform some five feet
high over a slow fire, in which position it is allowed to remain for
some three or four days, the mouth of the vessel remaining open for the
first day or two, though it is afterwards covered. It only then remains
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>add water <i>ad libitum</i>, and to pour out the
beer, after well shaking the vessel, through a rude straining apparatus
composed of rice-straw. It is said that the direct action of fire is
not really needed in the preparation of this beer and that exposure to
the sun is sufficient for the purpose, though the application of fire
undoubtedly quickens the process. Rice prepared in this way may be kept
in the earthenware vessel for six or twelve months, a fresh supply of
boiled rice and condiment (<i>em&aacute;o</i>) being added to the old
from time to time; but the beer is rarely kept in this way for any very
prolonged period, though its quality is said to be improved by such
keeping.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be added that the beverage so prepared would seem to
be a thoroughly wholesome or at least a comparatively harmless one.
Very large quantities are, to the writer&rsquo;s knowledge, sometimes
consumed at a sitting, the consumer&rsquo;s brain apparently remaining
wholly unaffected thereby. There is, however, a far less innocent
beverage, commonly known as <i>phatik&aacute;</i>, prepared from this
rice-beer by a process of distillation. This is a raw fiery spirit,
somewhat resembling in taste the crudest possible whisky; and its use
might very fittingly be put under severe restrictions by
taxation<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1171src" href="#xd26e1171" name=
"xd26e1171src">6</a> or otherwise, with results most beneficial to the
physical, mental and moral well-being of this very interesting
race.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote"><i>Eri</i> silk culture.</span> One of the
chief industries, a very profitable one among the Kach&aacute;ris, is
that of the culture of the silk-worm known as <i>eri</i>, and the
manufacture of the <i>eri</i> cloth. The <i>eri</i> cocoons, which are
about 2&frac12; or 3 inches in length, may often be seen suspended, a
few feet from the ground, in long festoons, a thin cord being passed
through the base of the cocoons for this purpose. In this condition the
cocoons remain for some fifteen days, at the end of which period the
insects make their appearance in the butterfly stage. Before they are
able to fly away, they are collected with care and placed in a suitable
receptacle; and at the end of three or four days eggs resembling
sago-grains make their appearance in great numbers. It is said that one
insect can on an average produce from eighty to one hundred such eggs,
or even more. In a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>further period of fifteen days the eggs are
duly hatched, the new-born insect being at first almost black, from
which colour it passes to brown, and finally to white, at intervals of
three or four days; and at each change of colour the worm is said to
cast its skin in snake-like fashion. Some four days after the last
stage is reached, <i>i.e.</i>, about fifteen days after being hatched,
the insect may be expected to set about the formation of its cocoon. To
assist it in this work, small bundles of plantain or mango leaves are
loosely tied together and placed within broad baskets or on bamboo
platforms, and the insects are then carefully placed within these
bundles; and under favourable conditions the cocoon should be fully
formed in about twenty-four hours. The actual formation of the cocoon
is preceded by certain signs, very significant to the Kach&aacute;ri,
<i>i.e.</i>, the insect itself refuses food for a short time beforehand
and becomes of a light, brilliant colour; and on handling it gently, a
soft, rustling sound, proceeding from the insect itself, can be
distinctly heard. After being carefully cleaned in water and dried in
the sun, the cocoons are stowed away, usually in an earthenware vessel,
until a fitting time, generally in the dry, cold season, appears for
reeling them off, a work carried out by women and girls. It is said
that a Kach&aacute;ri, working steadily at this occupation, can on an
average reel off some 150 or 200 cocoons in a day. During the fifteen
days preceding the formation of the cocoon, the insects&rsquo; quarters
must be kept scrupulously clean, and food carefully and regularly
provided<span class="corr" id="xd26e1201" title=

oil) plant,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1207src" href="#xd26e1207" name=
"xd26e1207src">7</a> which gives its name alike to the insect itself as
well as to the silk prepared from its cocoons. But it also feeds freely
on the leaves of certain trees known in Assamese as
<i>Kurung&aacute;</i>, <i>G&aacute;m&aacute;ri</i> and <i>Sangla</i>,
especially the first named of the three.</p>
<p>The loom employed for weaving the <i>eri</i> silk is of very simple
construction, and most, if not all, the material needed for the purpose
can be provided by the villagers themselves from local resources.</p>

<p>The market value of a loom of this character is said to be about
five rupees. It is usually set up on a shady side of the
dwelling-house, or, where this is impracticable, a rude structure
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>of thatch and bamboo work is provided to shield
the weaver from the sun. The actual work is always carried out either
by the lady of the house, or by one of her grown-up daughters; and it
is in every way suitable to women workers, as it requires very little
exertion of physical strength, but only a certain quickness and
readiness of eye and hand. The conditions under which the industry is
carried on are in all respects pleasing and satisfactory. Indeed, a
Kach&aacute;ri woman working placidly and contentedly at the <i>eri</i>
loom, singing quietly to herself in sheer happiness of heart, offers
perhaps one of the most complete illustrations of the benevolent
influence of the Pax Britannica to be found in the wide realm of India,
especially when it is borne in mind that less than seventy years ago
these Kach&aacute;ri Duars were subject to the Bhutan Rajas, who seem
to have harried and plundered the people in the most cruel and lawless
way. Soon after the master of the house, with one or more grown-up
sons, has betaken himself to the rice-fields, and this he does almost
at sunrise, his goodwife seats herself at the loom, and works away
steadily until about 8 or 9 a.m., when she may be seen carrying a
well-cooked and appetising meal, carefully shielded from rain and sun
by plantain leaves, to her goodman, who from an early hour has been
toiling in the fields for the good of the family. This duty discharged,
she resumes her position at the loom for the greater part of what may
remain of daylight. Immediately in front of the loom there are probably
two or three small children (the Kach&aacute;ri race is a wholesomely
prolific one) gambolling and tumbling over each other in high delight.
To these the mother now and then devotes a word or two of remonstrance,
whenever their gambols seem to threaten an infantile breach of the
peace; and she may occasionally rise from her seat to administer some
little corporal chastisement, though always &ldquo;more in sorrow than
in anger&rdquo;; but otherwise she devotes herself steadily and
assiduously to the work in hand. It is said that a Kach&aacute;ri
woman, if not greatly or frequently interrupted in her work, can weave
about half a yard each day; and, as this <i>eri</i> cloth, woven in
long strips about two yards wide, can always command a ready sale at
about Rs. 2/- per yard, it will be at once evident that a good worker
can in this way, without neglecting other urgent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>domestic
duties, easily make a substantial addition to the family income.</p>
<p>The fabric itself (<i>eri</i> cloth), so produced, is one of great
value, especially for use in the cold season, being at once soft and
warm as well as remarkably strong and durable. Of its very great merit
in this last-mentioned respect (durability) the writer has good reason
to hold a very high opinion. Some twelve or fifteen years ago he was
presented with a piece of <i>eri</i> cloth by one Leah
Kh&aacute;ngkhu&aacute;h, a good Kach&aacute;ri churchwoman, living not
far from St. Paul&rsquo;s Mission Church, at Bengbari, whose payment of
her &ldquo;Church dues&rdquo; (tithe) took this very pleasing and
highly practical form. The quantity of cloth given (the donor declined
all money payment) was sufficient to make two ample bed-sheets, and in
this character they have been in use now for at least a dozen years
past. During that period they have of course been subjected to many and
frequent barbarous washings; but even the rough treatment they have so
often received at the hands of the Assamese <i>dhobi</i> has as yet
failed to make any impression for injury on the warp and woof of this
sound material; so substantial and conscientious is the work done by
this good Kach&aacute;ri churchwoman and gentlewoman.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Position, social and domestic, of
women.</span> Among the Kach&aacute;ris women do not perhaps occupy
quite the same influential position as seems to be enjoyed by their
sisters in the Khasi Hills, where something like a matriarchate
apparently holds the field of social and domestic life. Still, with
this interesting race the position of the wife and mother is far from
being a degraded one. The Kach&aacute;ri husband and householder has
neither sympathy with, nor tolerance for, that degrading and
demoralising creed &ldquo;which says that woman is but dust, a
soul-less toy for tyrant&rsquo;s lust.&rdquo; On the contrary, he
usually treats his wife with distinct respect, and regards her as an
equal and a companion to an extent which can hardly be said to be the
rule among many of the Indian peoples. Kach&aacute;ri women, both in
early life and as matrons, enjoy a large measure of freedom, a freedom
which is very rarely abused for evil purposes. On being spoken to on
the wayside, the Kach&aacute;ri woman will generally reply at once with
absolute frankness, looking the questioner straight in the face and yet
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>most perfect modesty. It has often happened to the
writer during the last forty years to enter a Kach&aacute;ri village
for preaching purposes, or with a view to opening a school. On asking
for the village headman, that personage is usually not slow in making
his appearance; and after a few friendly words he will, quite as a
matter of course, introduce his wife, and that with no small pride and
pleasure. In discharging this social duty, he will very commonly use
much the same language as may be heard among the working classes in
England. The phrase most common is &ldquo;Be &aacute;ng-ni
burui,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;This (is) my old woman.&rdquo; The words
are not used jeeringly at all, but with much real respect and
affection; and are obviously so regarded by the speaker&rsquo;s
life-partner, whose face and features, somewhat homely in themselves,
may often be seen to light up at once with a very pleased and pleasing
smile on hearing herself thus referred to by the sharer of her
life&rsquo;s joys and sorrows. There is, too, another consideration,
not perhaps altogether unknown in other parts of the world, which has
great weight with the Kach&aacute;ri paterfamilias, viz., that his
goodwife for the most part does not a little to provide for the family
needs in the matter of food and raiment. Her prowess at the loom has
been mentioned before; and besides this, the actual planting out of the
young rice-seedlings is for the most part carried through by the women.
And all this is habitually done without in any way neglecting or
slurring over the usual duties more strictly appropriate to the
goodwife and mother.</p>

<p class="first"><i>From a Photograph by Mrs. H. A. Colquhoun.</i></p>
</div>
<p>On the whole it may perhaps be safely said that the social and
domestic life of the Kach&aacute;ri is not without its pleasing and
satisfactory features. It is probably for the most part far sounder and
more wholesome than the life of great cities, whether in Asia or
Europe; and it is with no little dismay and sorrow that the writer
would see any hasty ill-considered attempts made to supplant or
override this simple, primitive, patriarchal life through the
introduction of a one-sided, materialistic civilisation. <span class=

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Internal Organisation.</span>
From such information as is available at the present day it a seems
fairly clear that the internal and tribal organisation of the
Kach&aacute;ri (Bara) race rested in early days, very largely at least,
on a totemistic basis, although it is only here and there that any real
regard for the totems can still be said to survive. In primitive days
these subdivisions, all at one time strictly endogamous,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1298src" href="#xd26e1298" name="xd26e1298src">1</a>
were probably very numerous. But in the case of many of these
sub-tribes all trace of their distinct existence would seem to have
passed away; and no restrictions on the intermarriage of members of
such sub-tribes as still survive are any longer recognised. Among septs
or sub-tribes whose names still to some extent hold the field may be
placed the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Swarga-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Swarga</i> = heaven). The
heaven-folk. This sub-tribe is said to be the highest of all; none of
its members ever worked as cultivators, for as a rule all
<i>deoris</i>, <i>ojhas</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>and others who took a leading part in
religious ceremonials, were chosen from this subdivision; and the
offerings made by worshippers were held to be sufficient for their
maintenance.</p>
<p>2. <i>Basumati-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Basumati</i> = earth). The
earth-folk. This clan has a certain privilege not possessed by any
other, <i>i.e.</i>, its members can bury their dead without in any way
purchasing ground for the grave or for the erection of the funeral
pyre.</p>
<p>3. <i>Mos&aacute;-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Mos&aacute;</i> = tiger),
otherwise known in Darrang as <i>B&#257;gh-l-aroi</i>
(<i>B&#257;gh-l-aroi</i>, the <i>l</i> is probably inserted for reasons
of euphony). The tiger-folk. The members of this sub-tribe claim
kindred with the tiger, and all the inhabitants of a village peopled by
them go into mourning on hearing that a tiger has died in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>4. <i>Kh&aacute;ngkhlo-&aacute;roi</i>. The <i>Khangkhlo</i>-folk.
<i>Khangkhlo</i> is apparently the name of a certain jungle grass, used
freely both at religious ceremonials and at festive gatherings and
merry-makings, of which the Kach&aacute;ris are very fond.</p>
<p>5. <i>Sibing-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Sibing</i>, sesamum, the Assamese
<i>til</i><a id="xd26e1369" name="xd26e1369"></a>). The sesamum-folk.
This sub-tribe is said to be the only one which in olden time was
allowed to cultivate sesamum plant, and its members still hold this
plant in special honour.</p>
<p>6. <i>G&aacute;ndret-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>G&aacute;ndret</i>, a leech
or slug, Assamese <i>Kumzeluka</i>). The leech-folk. This sub-tribe
holds the leech in high regard and cannot under ordinary circumstances
kill it; though on occasions of certain religious ceremonials,
<i>e.g.</i>, purification after a death in the family, its members were
required to chew a leech with vegetables for a certain limited period,
though apparently only once in a life-time.</p>
<p>7. <i>N&aacute;rze-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>n&aacute;rze</i> = jute). The
jute-folk. This sub-tribe held jute in special honour, and on occasions
of great religious ceremonials its members were bound to chew a certain
quantity of jute (see No. 6).</p>
<p>8. <i>Doim&aacute;-roi</i> (<i>Doim&aacute;</i> = a large river)
(<i>cf.</i> Dim&aacute;s&aacute; [<i>doim&aacute;-s&aacute;</i>], the
usual designation of the people of the North Cachar Hills). The
river-folk. These in olden time were the fisherman class, though its
surviving members are now merged among the mass of ordinary
cultivators.</p>
<p>9. <i>Bibiziy&aacute;-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Bib&iacute;na</i> = to
beg). The begging-folk. Professional mendicants having no fixed home or
regular occupation, much like the modern Fakirs, Vairagis, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>10. <i>Bing-bing-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>Bing-bing</i>, probably an
onomatopoetic word indicating a sound more or less musical). Itinerant
musicians, subsisting on the voluntary offerings of those to whom they
ministered. The writer has occasionally seen one or two members of this
class in Kach&aacute;ri villages.</p>
<p>11. <i>Ding-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>ding&aacute;</i> = a bamboo
water-vessel [Assamese <i>Chung&aacute;</i>]).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1436src" href="#xd26e1436" name="xd26e1436src">2</a> The
<i>dinga</i>-folk. The members of this sub-tribe are said to have
formerly earned their livelihood by making, these bamboo
water-vessels.</p>
<p>12. <i>Goi-b&aacute;ri-&aacute;roi</i> (<i>goi</i> = the
areca-palm<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1450src" href="#xd26e1450" name=
"xd26e1450src">3</a>). The areca-folk; formerly devoted to the
cultivation of the areca, of which they perhaps held the monopoly.</p>
<p>In addition to the above sub-tribes, all at one time strictly
endogamous, though now no longer so, the following may be mentioned. It
may be noted that these are recognised, in Kamrup at least, mostly to
the north of the great earthwork embankment known as the &ldquo;Gossain
Kamla Ali,&rdquo; though the writer has been unable to find any trace
of their separate existence in this (Darrang) district.</p>
<p>13. <i>R&aacute;msh&aacute;roi.</i> <i>R&aacute;msh&aacute;</i>
folk. <i>R&aacute;msh&aacute;</i> is said to be the name of a Mauza in
Kamrup.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1471src" href="#xd26e1471" name=
"xd26e1471src">4</a> It may be noted further that R&aacute;m-s&aacute;
(?Ram&rsquo;s people) is the name by which the Kach&aacute;ris living
in the plains are known to their brethren in the North Cachar
Hills.</p>
<p>14. <i>Brahm-&aacute;roi.</i> Brahma folk. Said to be a
quasi-priestly class, found chiefly in Upper Assam. This name, like the
preceding, is obviously of Hindu origin.</p>
<p>15. <i>B&aacute;nhb&aacute;r&aacute;-roi.</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1483src" href="#xd26e1483" name="xd26e1483src">5</a>
Bamboo-grove-folk. (<i>B&#257;nhb&#257;ri</i> = Assamese) is the sacred
bamboo grove, found near many Kach&aacute;ri villages, where the
worship of the gods is carried on at certain seasons.</p>
<p>16. <i>Dheki&aacute;b&aacute;ri-&aacute;roi.</i> (Dheki&aacute;
fern), the fern-folk. The totem of this sub-tribe was probably the
fern, still sometimes used in the preparation of the
<i>fatik&aacute;</i> spirit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>17. <i>M&aacute;&oacute;mar&aacute;-roi.</i> The
M&aacute;&oacute;-fish folk, perhaps originally the dwellers near the
Moam&aacute;ri bil.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1509src" href=
"#xd26e1509" name="xd26e1509src">6</a></p>
<p>18. <i>Kherkhath&aacute;-roi</i> (<i>Kerketu&aacute;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1520src" href="#xd26e1520" name="xd26e1520src">7</a>
squirrel). The squirrel-folk. Said to be a low caste and more or less
criminal. One of their functions is to cut the horns of cattle.</p>
<p>19. <i>Fadam-&aacute;roi.</i> The <i>fadam</i> folk. The
<i>fadam</i> is said to be identical with the tree known as
<i>s&aacute;chi</i> in Assamese.</p>
<p>20. <i>Mohil&aacute;-roi.</i> Mohil&aacute; folk. Mohil&aacute; is a
word of uncertain origin and meaning. It is said to be the equivalent
of Mah&aacute;ld&aacute;r, and to be applied to fishery lessees, and
petty traders in areca-nut and betel-leaves and dried fish
(<i>n&#257;-gr&#257;n</i>).</p>
<p>It may perhaps be added that among the Meches in
Gow&aacute;lp&aacute;r&aacute; some sixteen of these subdivisions are
recognised, all formerly exogamous.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1548src"
href="#xd26e1548" name="xd26e1548src">8</a> In designating these
subdivisions the same suffix (<i>&aacute;roi</i> or <i>roi</i>) is used
as that characteristic of the Kamrup and Darrang Kach&aacute;ris:
indeed, the names correspond closely in every respect,
<i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Swarg-&aacute;roi</i>,</li>
<li><i>Mas&aacute;-roi</i>,</li>
<li><i>Doim&aacute;-roi</i>,</li>
<li><i>Goib&aacute;ri-roi</i>,</li>
</ul>
<p>which seems to be practically identical with class-names Nos. 1, 3,
8 and 12, given above.</p>
<p>But it is among the Dim&aacute;s&aacute; of the North Cachar Hills
and the Hojais of the Nowgong district that this minute subdivision of
the clans would seem to attain its highest development. In this portion
of the Bara race some eighty clans are recognised, of whom forty are
known as men&rsquo;s clans (<i>sengf&aacute;ng</i>) and forty as
women&rsquo;s (<i>z&#365;lu</i>). All the members of these different
clans eat and drink together freely, and are, or were, all strictly
exogamous.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1588src" href="#xd26e1588" name=
"xd26e1588src">9</a> The only exception to this strict rule
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>of exogamy is that of the so-called royal clan,
known as H&aacute;-chum-s&aacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1595src"
href="#xd26e1595" name="xd26e1595src">10</a> <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;black
earth folk,&rdquo; all the members of which were compelled to marry
<i>within</i> their own sub-tribe, marriage with a member of a subject
clan being of old absolutely forbidden. (<i>Cf.</i> the analogous
restrictions enforced by various &ldquo;Royal Marriage&rdquo; Acts in
other communities.)</p>
<p>In partial explanation of the terms used (their number might
probably be largely added to on further inquiry), it will be observed
that the first two are obviously of Hindu origin, the Kach&aacute;ri
affix <i>&aacute;roi</i> (people, folk) being attached to the Sanskrit
words <i>Swarga</i> and <i>Vasumati</i> respectively. Most of the
designations applied to the other sub-tribes merely indicate the
occupation, probably hereditary, by which the members of these
sub-tribes obtained their livelihood. But in almost every case, in
these modern days, any special reverence for the totem has very largely
become a thing of the past. There is, perhaps, one exception to this
rule, that of the tiger-folk (<i>Mos&aacute;roi</i> or
<i>B&#257;ghl&aacute;roi</i>). (The <i>l</i> in this latter word is
probably merely euphonic, so that the two words have exactly the same
meaning). Kach&aacute;ris of the old-fashioned conservative school
still think it a duty to show respect to their totem (the tiger) by
formally going into mourning whenever they learn that one of these
animals has died in the immediate vicinity of their village. The period
of mourning is indeed but a short one, seldom exceeding twenty-four
hours; but during this brief period the sorrowing would seem to be very
real, and not a little material loss is sometimes involved. No solid
food whatever must be taken, in itself no slight privation to the
Kach&aacute;ri, who is as a rule provided with an ample appetite. At
the end of the mourning the floor and walls of each house must be
carefully smeared with a freshly prepared compost of mud and cow-dung,
a work usually carried out by the women. All articles of clothing, as
well as all household utensils made of brass, must be thoroughly
cleansed in running water, whilst all earthenware vessels except those
which are quite new and have never yet been used for cooking purposes,
must be broken up and thrown away. Then one of the elder members of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>community, acting as Deori (minister), solemnly
distributes the &ldquo;water of peace&rdquo;
(<i>&#346;&aacute;nti-Jal</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1637src"
href="#xd26e1637" name="xd26e1637src">11</a> to be drunk by all in
turn; and the buildings themselves and all articles of clothing,
&amp;c., are freely sprinkled with this preparation. The service is
finally consummated by the sacrifice of a fowl or pig, to be partaken
of by all in common; after which relations of ordinary social
intercourse with the neighbours may be quietly resumed.</p>

Exogamy</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is said that each of the sub-tribes mentioned above
was in early times strictly endogamous; for though members of all these
subdivisions might freely eat and drink together, intermarriage between
them was absolutely forbidden. But all such restrictions on marriage
seem to have passed away long since, so that the whole subject has
nowadays little more than an antiquarian interest.</p>
<p>No formal hypergamy is recognised, though Kach&aacute;ris
occasionally take wives from the cognate tribes known as R&aacute;bhas
(Totl&aacute;s), Koches (Mad&aacute;his), and Saraniyas, &amp;c. But
such alliances are as a rule not looked upon with favour, and the
bridegroom in such cases has generally to make his peace with his
fellow-villagers by providing them with a feast in which rice-beer
(<i>Zu</i>) and pork are certain to take a prominent place. Children
born of such mixed marriages become in all cases members of the
father&rsquo;s subdivision of the Bodo race.</p>
<p>There is little or nothing specially distinctive in the laws of
consanguinity or affinity in their bearing on the marriage
relationship. A widower may marry his deceased wife&rsquo;s younger
sister, but not the elder, whom he is taught to regard conventionally
in the light of a mother. Much the same principle holds good in the
case of the re-marriage of widows, which is freely permitted, the one
limitation being that a widow may marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s
younger brother, but not the elder. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As a rule the Kach&aacute;ris are a strictly
monogamous race, though cases of men having two wives have occasionally
come under the writer&rsquo;s notice. These cases are, however, almost
invariably limited to men of a somewhat high social position or great
wealth, such as Mauzad&aacute;rs, Mandals, &amp;c. Where, too, a first
wife proves childless, Kach&aacute;ri custom sanctions the taking of a
second, mainly with a view to handing down the father&rsquo;s name to
posterity. On the other hand, polyandry would seem to be absolutely
prohibited, though it is known to prevail in the adjoining regions of
Bhutan, Tibet, &amp;c.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Children, more especially orphans, are occasionally
adopted, usually by near relatives, but sometimes by absolute
strangers. In such cases the children so adopted are treated as full
members of the family, and the foster-parents are considered by the
community to have done a highly meritorious act. Several pleasing
instances of adoption of this character have come under the
writer&rsquo;s notice, and in all such cases the adopted children seem
to have found a very happy home.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>Female Chastity</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As stated above, the standard of chastity among the
Kach&aacute;ris, both men and women, is by no means a low one. As a
rule the young people, in the villages at least, lead pure lives before
marriage, and are faithful to their marriage vows in after-life. In
cases where there are several unmarried girls in a family, and one of
them is suspected of having broken the law of chastity, the following
plan for detecting the offender is sometimes adopted. The whole family
gathers in the evening around the sacred <i>siju</i> tree (<i>Euphorbia
splendens</i>), which is often to be seen growing in the court-yard,
surrounded by a fence of split bamboo. At the foot of this revered tree
a quantity of rice (uncooked) is solemnly buried and allowed to remain
there over night. Early next morning this rice is carefully
disinterred, and a certain quantity given to each grown-up girl
(<i>sikhl&aacute;</i>) to be masticated. The offender, under the
pressure of the fear of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>imminent detection, is unable to
masticate her portion of rice, the faculty of secreting saliva failing
her in her terror of discovery and disgrace.</p>

<p class="first"><i>From a Photograph by Mrs. H. A. Colquhoun.</i></p>
</div>
<p>She is then made to disclose the name of her paramour, whom
Kach&aacute;ri public opinion compels to marry his victim forthwith,
the bride-price (<i>pan</i>: see below) being in this case considerably
enhanced as some slight compensation to the girl&rsquo;s parents for
the injury done to the honour of the family. A similar procedure is
sometimes resorted to in cases of suspected theft or other like
misdemeanours in the family circle.</p>
<p>In some cases where the parents are unwilling to part with their
daughter to a prospective son-in-law of somewhat objectionable
character, the matter is referred for decision to the village elders,
who impose a fine of Rs. 20/- to Rs. 25/- on the offender. But whenever
pregnancy follows offences against the law of chastity, marriage
becomes absolutely compulsory, and the seducer is made to feel that he
has brought disgrace upon the village, and is distinctly under a cloud.
In this way a wholesome respect for chastity is maintained, and
Kach&aacute;ri domestic life is kept comparatively pure.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Divorce</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Divorce sometimes takes place by mutual consent, but
cannot be effected without a certain formality. Man and wife appear
before the village elders and state their case, concluding by tearing a
pan-leaf into two pieces, <i>f&aacute;thoi fes&iacute;nai</i>,
(<i>K.</i>) <i>p&aacute;n chir&aacute;</i> (Assamese), a symbolic act
indicating that, as the sundered leaf can never reunite, so their own
married life is severed for ever. Should the husband divorce his wife
for causes which seem to the village elders inadequate or capricious,
he forfeits all claim to reimbursement of his marriage expenses, and
even when the divorce is approved of, he must pay a certain small sum
(Rs. 5/- to 10/-) for his freedom, the amount being divided between the
village <i>panch&aacute;yat</i> and the divorced woman. On the other
hand, if the woman is divorced for just and sufficient reasons,
<i>e.g.</i>, for unfaithfulness to her marriage obligations, the
injured husband is entitled to recover whatever he may have expended at
his marriage, a sum amounting sometimes to Rs. 140/- or upwards to Rs.
200/-. The man who may afterwards marry the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>divorced
woman is held to be responsible for the payment of this money; and so
long as this latter condition is duly fulfilled, the divorc&eacute;e is
fully at liberty to live with a second husband.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Inheritance of Property</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the Kach&aacute;ris the laws and customs
relating to the inheritance of property seem to be very vague, and it
is not at all easy to obtain any definite information on the subject.
Generally speaking, on the decease of the head of the household the
eldest son takes charge of all property, making a home for the time for
his widowed mother and his brothers and sisters. In this way the family
may be kept together for some years; but eventually it breaks up as the
children grow up and marry, in which case the father&rsquo;s property
is broken up into equal shares, the eldest son taking one share and a
half, while what remains is divided fairly among the other brothers.
The daughters, especially if married, can claim nothing. When a man
dies without sons, the property usually passes to his eldest surviving
brother, who generally makes some provision for the deceased
man&rsquo;s widow and daughters.</p>
<p>Disputes, whether matrimonial or otherwise (<i>e.g.</i>, inheritance
of property, &amp;c.), are almost invariably referred to the council of
village elders, whose members are not necessarily limited to five or
other definite number; and the decision of this rural council is very
rarely questioned or opposed in any way. It might be well to develop
and enlarge this simple and very effective way of settling disputes, so
that the villagers may be to a great extent saved from the necessity of
coming under the contaminating, demoralising influence of our civil and
criminal courts. As all the Kach&aacute;ris of this district (Darrang)
are ordinary cultivators, holding land directly under Government like
their Hindu and Musulman neighbours, no remarks are needed under the
head of &ldquo;tenure of land, and laws regarding land.&rdquo; So too
with the sections dealing with &ldquo;war, and head-hunting,&rdquo; it
is only necessary to say that the latter practice (head-hunting) is
quite unknown here, though it would seem to have been very common in
earlier days among the closely cognate race known to us as Garos.

point Col. Gurdon, Hon. Director of Ethnography, Assam, writes as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I entertain grave doubts as to the correctness of
the author&rsquo;s remark that the Kach&aacute;ri totemistic clans were
originally endogamous. If it had not been for the most unfortunate
death of the author before this work went to press, we might have hoped
to have had some light on this obscure point. Amongst the Mech, who are
the first cousins of the Kach&aacute;ris, and who live alongside of
them, marriage is exogamous, vide page 124 of the Monograph, so also
amongst the Garos, who may be described as second cousins of the
Kach&aacute;ris. Mr. Friel, Sub-Divisional Officer of Mangaldai, which
division of the Darrang district contains a large number of
Kach&aacute;ris, met an old Kach&aacute;ri who stated quite positively
that &lsquo;before the Dewangari war, Kach&aacute;ris were not allowed
to marry within their own sub-tribe.&rsquo; It is true that Mr.
Friel&rsquo;s informant afterwards contradicted himself, but I think it
is quite possible his first statement was the correct one. On the other
hand, it should be stated in favour of Mr. Endle&rsquo;s theory that
three men were found in Sekhar mauza of Mangaldai who stated that in
former days &lsquo;a penance had to be performed if one married outside
one&rsquo;s own <i>kur</i>.&rsquo; My own view, however, is that stated
above, and I do not think the statement that the Kach&aacute;ri
totemistic clans were endogamous should be accepted without further
investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">Religion</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">General character of popular
beliefs.</span> The religion of the Kach&aacute;ri race is distinctly
of the type commonly known as &ldquo;animistic,&rdquo; and its
underlying principle is characteristically one of <i>fear</i> or
<i>dread</i>. The statement &ldquo;<i>Timor fecit deos</i>&rdquo;
certainly holds good of this people in its widest and strictest sense;
and their religion thus stands in very marked, not to say violent,
contrast<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1757src" href="#xd26e1757" name=
"xd26e1757src">1</a> with the teaching of the Faith in Christ. In the
typical Kach&aacute;ri village as a rule neither idol nor place of
worship is to be found; but to the Kach&aacute;ri mind and imagination
earth, air, and sky are alike peopled with a vast number of invisible
spiritual beings, known usually as &ldquo;Modai,&rdquo; all possessing
powers and faculties far greater than those of man, and almost
invariably inclined to use these powers for malignant and malevolent,
rather than benevolent, purposes. In a certain stage of moral and
spiritual development men are undoubtedly influenced far more by what
they <i>fear</i> than by what they <i>love</i>; and this truth
certainly applies to the Kach&aacute;ri race in the most unqualified
way. The Kach&aacute;ri Duars of this district (Darrang) were in
earlier days looked upon as being especially unhealthy, and to some
extent they retain that character still. It has repeatedly fallen to
the lot of the writer, when entering a Kach&aacute;ri village to find
one or more of its inhabitants prostrate with malarial fever of a
virulent type; and on asking what was wrong the reply has very commonly
been &ldquo;<i>modai</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1772src" href=
"#xd26e1772" name="xd26e1772src">2</a> <i>h&#257;mdang</i>,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, an (evil) spirit has got <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>hold (of me). And this
reply may be looked upon as typical and characteristic, and as
accurately expressing the very spirit and true inwardness of
Kach&aacute;ri religion. Of sin, <i>i.e.</i>, the conscious violation
of the moral Law of a righteous God, the Kach&aacute;ri has of course
no idea whatever. But he does believe in the existence and active
interference in the affairs of men of certain invisible spiritual
beings who are the authors of sickness, famine, earthquakes, &amp;c.;
who are for the most part influenced by malevolent motives, and whose
ill-will towards mankind must be propitiated and bought off by frequent
offerings of rice, plantains, pigs, goats, poultry, &amp;c., in ways
regarding which some little information is given below.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Worship of ancestors.</span> 1.
Ancestor-worship would not seem to be in vogue to any extent among the
Kach&aacute;ris of this district, though perhaps it is not altogether
unknown; <i>e.g.</i>, when the head of a family or other man of note
passes away, it is not unusual at certain festivals to place on a
platform a small quantity of the viands of which the deceased was known
to be fond during his lifetime on earth, presumably for his use and
behoof. No adult members of the village community will ever presume to
touch these viands, though the village children are apparently at
liberty to consume them at their pleasure.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Worship of natural forces.</span> 2. The
worship of natural forces also would seem to be not at all common,
though some traces of it may perhaps be noted here and there. For
instance, (A) in connection with the popular festival known as the
April (Vais&aacute;kh) <i>Bihu</i>, there takes place what is called
the &ldquo;<i>Parwa</i>&rdquo; show or <i>bhotheli</i>, a festival
apparently common to Hindu and Kach&aacute;ri alike. The <i>parwa</i>
is a tall bamboo pole draped with rags, flags, &amp;c., taken from the
village on the last day of the <i>Bihu</i>, and put up in a field
alongside a tree, where the people amuse themselves by dancing,
wrestling, and tom-toming, &amp;c., around it. It is possible that this
may be a relic or survival of phallic worship, the <i>parwa</i> taking
the place of the lingam or phallus. (B) Again, water would seem to have
about it something of a sacred character in the mind of the average
Kach&aacute;ri. The dead are often buried or cremated on or near the
banks of running streams, which are also favourite localities for the
celebration of the greater <i>pujas</i>. This reverence for water is
perhaps specially marked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>among the Kach&aacute;ris of
North-east Bengal (Jalpaiguri, &amp;c), in which part of the Province,
Mr. Bryan Hodgson informs us, all the smaller streams are regarded as a
kind of lesser deities (<i>dii inferiores</i>), whilst the Brahmaputra
is looked upon as the <i>mother</i> of them all (<i>mater magna</i>).
It may be noted also in this connection that one of the principal
branches of the widely spread Bara race, <i>i.e.</i>, the people of the
North Cachar Hills, still speak of themselves as
<i>Di-m&aacute;-s&aacute;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;sons of the big
river,&rdquo; or &ldquo;children of the great water,&rdquo; even though
none of them would seem now to dwell anywhere near a large river or
lake, &amp;c. It may therefore perhaps be safely inferred that the
element of water, though now apparently not often actually worshipped,
has ever been held in special regard by the Kach&aacute;ri race.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Worship of deities.</span> The
Kach&aacute;ri Pantheon is a very extensive one, though it seems
probable that only a comparatively small number are strictly of tribal
or national origin, many having obviously been borrowed from their
Hindu neighbours. The popular Kach&aacute;ri deities fall naturally
into two classes, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) household gods (<i>n&#259;-ni
mad&aacute;i</i>); (2) village gods (<i>g&aacute;mi-ni
mad&aacute;i</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1875src" href=
"#xd26e1875" name="xd26e1875src">3</a> The former are worshipped
<i>inside</i> the house, or at least in the homestead (compound); the
latter by the whole village collectively, <i>outside</i> the house, and
usually near the sacred grove of trees or bamboos, often to be seen
some fifteen or twenty yards from the village, and known as the
<i>th&#257;ns&#257;li</i>. A long list of these gods is given in an
interesting paper by Maulvi Mahibuddin Ahmed, some nineteen names of
household gods being therein enumerated, whilst the village gods number
no fewer than sixty-five. Only a small proportion of these deities
would, however, seem to obtain recognition in this district (Darrang),
and it hardly seems necessary to mention by name more than a few of
them.</p>

<h4 class="main">1. B&aacute;th&aacute;u (<i>Siju</i>, i.e.,
<i>Euphorbia splendens</i>).</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of these household gods by far the most important is
the first-mentioned, <i>i.e.</i>, B&aacute;th&aacute;u, who is
pre-eminently the guardian of the family interests and family honour.
He is never represented in idol form, but is well in evidence through
his living symbol, the <i>siju</i> (<i>hiju</i>) tree (<i>Euphorbia
splendens</i>), which is often to be seen in the Kach&aacute;ri
homestead surrounded by a circular fence of split bamboo. Among the
Meches of Goalpara, almost every home, it is said, has its
<i>B&aacute;th&aacute;u</i> (<i>siju</i>), though in Darrang it is less
frequently met with. B&aacute;th&aacute;u is said not to be worshipped
separately, but always in conjunction with Ai-Deo. Inside the house a
slightly raised altar, called <i>dh&aacute;m</i>, is often erected in
honour of Song R&aacute;j&aacute;, and at this women especially pay
their devotions and make offerings, particularly at the monthly periods
(menses). All offerings, however, made to Song R&aacute;j&aacute; are
finally brought outside the house, and laid at the foot of
B&aacute;th&aacute;u; and the writer has often seen such offerings in
the form of heads of goats, pigs, fowls, &amp;c., as well as plantains,
<i>t&aacute;mul</i>-nuts, <i>p&aacute;n</i>-leaves, <i>gazi</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, a mixture of rice and pulse), &amp;c., humbly laid down
for B&aacute;th&aacute;u&rsquo;s acceptance. In this way it is held
that disease, famine, and misfortunes of all kinds may be kept at bay,
through the influence of this powerful guardian of the family interest
and well-being.</p>

<p>It may be added that it is apparently only among the northern
section of the Kach&aacute;ri race that the <i>siju</i> tree is
regarded with special reverence. The Garos are said to know this tree
and to use certain parts of it for medical purposes <i>e.g.</i>, the
preparation of poultices, &amp;c.; but to them it is never an object of
worship. The Dim&aacute;s&aacute; of the North Cachar Hills,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=

emblem visible to the human eye. Her special function is that of
&ldquo;Guardian of the rice-fields&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1999src" href="#xd26e1999" name="xd26e1999src">4</a> and among a
purely agricultural community like that of the Kach&aacute;ris, she of
course is held in very high regard. She is, in short, to the
Kach&aacute;ri peasant very much what Ceres was to the old heathen
Roman cultivator. Eggs are the offering that finds most favour in her
eyes, and these are presented to her in unstinted quantity. She is
apparently especially worshipped at the period of harvesting the
<i>&aacute;&#347;u</i> and <i>&#347;&aacute;li</i> crops; hence the
twofold designation given above (Nos. 3 and 4, household gods),
&Aacute;su Main&aacute;o, and &#346;&aacute;li Main&aacute;o.</p>
<p>Of the other domestic deities above mentioned, it is not necessary
to say much. Nos. 5 and 6 (Song R&aacute;j&aacute; and Song
Br&aacute;i) seem to be the especial objects of devotion to women,
worshipped for the most part inside the house, whilst No. 7
(Bur&aacute; B&aacute;gh R&aacute;j&aacute;) is apparently merely the
name of the tiger, often spoken of with bated breath as the
&ldquo;monarch of the woods&rdquo; (<i>banar-r&aacute;j&aacute;</i>),
especially by men travelling at night, when danger from the tiger may
well be apprehended.</p>

<h3 class="main">B. <i>Village Deities.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There would seem to be little need to dwell much on
the village deities; for no small proportion of them have evidently
been adopted from the Hindu Pantheon, as will be obvious from the names
given below. Some sixty-five such names are given in the valuable paper
above mentioned of village deities recognised in Kamrup, though the
writer only knows of some three or four of these gods as reverenced in
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>district (Darrang). Among these may perhaps be
mentioned the following:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Mero r&aacute;j&aacute;.</li>
<li>2. Bur&aacute; Mah&aacute;deo.</li>
<li>3. Bur&aacute; gosain.</li>
<li>4. Jal Kub&eacute;r.</li>
<li>5. Thal Kub&eacute;r.</li>
<li>6. Ih Kub&eacute;r.</li>
<li>7. Bih Kub&eacute;r.</li>
<li>8. Kuber brai (masculine).</li>
<li>9. Kuber brui (feminine).</li>
<li>10. Sila Rai, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is needless to continue the list, for almost all the names are
obviously borrowed from popular Hinduism; <i>e.g.</i>, Kuber is almost
certainly the Hindu god of wealth and of the lower regions (Pluto).
Others are in all likelihood merely names of deified mortals of some
pre-eminence above their fellow men; <i>cf.</i> Ram, Krishna, &amp;c. A
notable illustration of this principle of deification is probably that
given as No. 10 in the above list, <i>i.e.</i>, Sila Rai.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2077src" href="#xd26e2077" name="xd26e2077src">5</a>
This is almost certainly the name of the well-known Commander-in-Chief
of the most famous of the Koch Kings, Nar Narayan, in whose time the
Koch kingdom reached the zenith of its power. As a soldier and
commander this man (Sila Rai) seems to have been the foremost captain
of his time in North-east India; and his striking personality would
seem so to have impressed the minds and imaginations of his
contemporaries as to lead to his apotheosis after death.</p>
<p>As might be expected among a purely agricultural community, the
great annual <i>pujas</i>, which are three in number, are directly
connected with the ingathering of the three chief rice crops of the
year, <i>i.e.</i>, the &Aacute;hu, Pharma, and &#346;&aacute;li crops.
The dates for these annual <i>pujas</i> do not seem to be at all
rigidly fixed, but are apparently settled by the village elders to meet
the public convenience. There is no prescribed form of religious
worship; indeed, the whole gathering is rather of the nature of a
village merry-making than a religious service; and there is invariably
a very large consumption of the national beverage (rice-beer) at all
these gatherings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is said to be another <i>puja</i> known as <i>morong-puja</i>,
of which the special object is to propitiate the cholera demon, to whom
are made offerings of he-goats, pigeons, fowls and betel-nuts, &amp;c.
In addition to these, flowers, eggs, pounded rice-flour, &amp;c., are
sometimes placed on rafts and set afloat on a river; and occasionally
animals (goats, &amp;c.) are exposed in this way on rafts as an
oblation to the river god (<i>d&#466;i-ni madai</i>).<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2103src" href="#xd26e2103" name="xd26e2103src">6</a> It may be
taken for granted that, whenever these rafts are found on streams in
the Kach&aacute;ri country, cholera or other malignant disease is or
has been doing its deadly work among the people. In addition to the
<i>pujas</i> above mentioned, which are more or less of a general
character, offerings of goats, chickens, and a mixture of pulse and
rice known as <i>gazi</i>, are often placed at the foot of certain
trees, usually old trees, and finally left there. As a rule, only the
<i>heads</i> of the goats, chicken, &amp;c., so offered will be found
at the foot of such trees, the bodies of the slaughtered animals being
consumed by the offerers. These oblations are made, not by the village
community as a whole, but by the heads of individual families, some one
member of which is in severe trouble from sickness or other like cause.
The money value of such offerings is sometimes not inconsiderable.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Priesthood</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no authorised priestly caste among the
Kach&aacute;ris, nor are Brahmins ever employed in their religious
ceremonies, these latter indeed being generally of a social, and even
festive, rather than a religious character. In Kamrup, however, one of
the recognised sub-tribes is, or was, known as
&ldquo;Br&#257;hmar&#466;i,&rdquo; a name which seems to point to
Brahmins as having a certain standing in the B&aring;d&aring;
community. All religious offices are now discharged by <i>Deoris</i> or
<i>Deod&aacute;is</i>, who are usually men of a certain age and
recognised social position in the village community; village elders in
fact. The office is not hereditary, and any one versed in the usual
forms of exorcism, &amp;c., can discharge it. Another class of persons
employed in religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>ceremonies is known as the <i>Ojh&aacute;</i>
or <i>Ojh&aacute;-Bur&aacute;</i>, who is generally armed with shells,
cowries, &amp;c., by the manipulation of which he professes to be able
to foretell prosperity or the reverse to those who consult him. These
officials are supposed to be competent to deal with the ordinary
ailments of village life by indicating the approximate method of
propitiating the offended deity (<i>modai</i>), whose anger is held to
be the cause of all the ills that flesh is heir to.</p>
<p>But in times of special emergency, <i>e.g.</i>, plague, pestilence,
famine, &amp;c., the services of the &ldquo;possessed&rdquo;
woman,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2148src" href="#xd26e2148" name=
"xd26e2148src">7</a> the <i>Deod&aacute;ni</i>, are called into action
for a special <i>puja</i> organised on a somewhat large scale. These
gatherings are not very common, but when they do occur the order of the
proceedings is something as follows, as occasionally witnessed by the
writer. A piece of ground about fifteen or twenty yards square, usually
on the bank of a running stream, is selected for the purpose. The
surface of the soil is carefully removed, and a rude screen of cotton
cloth some six or eight feet high erected on bamboos at the western
side of the cleared ground. At the eastern side a slight earthwork
embankment, some three or four inches high and about a foot broad is
thrown up; and on this a number of figures, usually seven or nine, but
always an <i>odd</i> number, bearing a rude resemblance to the outlines
of the human form, are placed in an upright position. These figures are
roughly made of jungle grass twisted together, and are about one foot
in height. Before each figure is placed a layer of the plantain tree
with its concave side upwards, and in this are deposited the heads of
slaughtered goats, pigeons, chickens, with salt, sugar-cane, plantains,
<i>gazi</i> (a mixture of rice and pulse), &amp;c., the whole being
freely sprinkled with blood and pounded rice flour
(<i>pith&aacute;guri</i>). The <i>Deod&aacute;ni</i>, a somewhat
weird-looking figure, with dishevelled hair, and vermilion-stained
forehead, wearing a long petticoat, dances up and down to and fro
before these figures, keeping time roughly with the music of cymbals
and tom-toms played by four or five men, who act as her assistants. The
ceremony is a prolonged one, often extending over many hours: and the
<i>Deod&aacute;ni</i>, whose faculties are apparently quite absorbed in
what she is doing and who seems <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>for the time to be lifted above
the world of time and sense, gradually works herself up to a state of
excitement bordering on frenzy. At this stage, which is only slowly
attained, a goat is brought forward and taken up before one of the
figures above mentioned, when the <i>Deod&aacute;ni</i>, with one
stroke of the long sacrificial sword, known as the <i>imfi</i> and
reserved exclusively for such purposes, severs the victim&rsquo;s head
from the body. Most of the blood is held to be offered in sacrifice to
the <i>mad&aacute;i</i>, before whose emblem the animal has been
slaughtered; but some part is said to be sprinkled on the persons of
the assembled worshippers. It is at this climax of the <i>puja</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, at the sacrificial slaughtering of the goat, that the
<i>Deod&aacute;ni</i> is supposed to become possessed of the knowledge
she is in search of, <i>i.e.</i>, the name of the offended deity who
has brought about the plague, &amp;c., and also the best method of
propitiating his anger; which usually involves an offering of pigs,
goats, &amp;c., to the angered god, and the giving of a feast to the
whole village community, the expense being defrayed by a general
contribution.</p>

<h3 class="main">1. <i>Ceremonies Attending Birth.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a Kach&aacute;ri village community there would seem
to be no formally recognised midwives (<i>dh&aacute;is</i>), any
respectable and competent matron being at liberty to give attendance
and assistance to the patient in such cases. In severing the umbilical
cord no scissors, knife, or other implement of steel is ever used, nor
is the severance effected at one stroke, but in a succession of slight
cuts, <i>seven</i> such cuts being made in the case of a girl, and only
<i>five</i> in that of a boy. The cutting instruments consist of thin
hard strips of bamboo,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2217src" href=
"#xd26e2217" name="xd26e2217src">8</a> shaped roughly into the form of
a knife; and a separate bamboo knife must be used in making each slight
cut, seven such knives being thus made use of for a female child and
five for a male. It is not unusual for one of the bystanders to give a
name to the newly-born child at the severing of the umbilical cord. The
good matron who officiates as midwife receives no money payment for her
services, but on the mother becoming convalescent a feast is given at
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>parent&rsquo;s expense, in which pork and other
flesh meat is always present in abundance; and at this feast the
officiating midwife is accorded the place of honour, as some
recognition of the value of her kindly ministrations in her
neighbour&rsquo;s hour of trial and need.</p>
<p>For about a month or six weeks, (the period seems to vary within
these limits) after giving birth to a child, the mother is held to be
technically &ldquo;unclean,&rdquo; and is subjected to certain social
and religious limitations; <i>e.g.</i>, she may not approach the
<i>dh&aacute;m</i> or domestic altar commonly found inside a
Kach&aacute;ri&rsquo;s dwelling-house, and on which she is ordinarily
in the habit of making offerings of eggs, chickens, &amp;c., in times
of trouble. This period of <i>ceremonial</i> uncleanness is usually
terminated by the use of the water of peace
(<i>&#347;&aacute;nti-jal</i>). The <i>deori</i> freely sprinkles the
mother as well as the house and its contents with this holy water,
after which she is fully at liberty to resume social intercourse with
her neighbours.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2242src" href="#xd26e2242"

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><i>Naming.</i></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There does not seem to be any special principle
underlying the giving of names to children, nor do such names as a rule
resemble those of their fathers. Like some of the lower castes among
their Hindu neighbours, children often take the name of the day or the
month in which they were born.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2253src"
href="#xd26e2253" name="xd26e2253src">10</a> Hence we often find such
names as Deobar, Mangal, Budhu, as also M&aacute;ghu&aacute;,
Ph&aacute;gun&aacute; (names of months), &amp;c., in use among the
Kach&aacute;ris. Other names are obviously adopted from the Hindus,
<i>e.g.</i>, Gang&aacute; R&aacute;m, S&aacute;ti R&aacute;m, &amp;c.
Others, again, were probably given by the mother in infancy expressive
of some peculiarity in the new-born child&rsquo;s mental or physical
temperament. Of this type, probably, is a very common name,
&ldquo;Kh&aacute;ngkho&aacute;,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the
&ldquo;voracious one,&rdquo; the &ldquo;great eater.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd26e2267src">11</a> Another illustration is the name

&amp;c. In short, any unusually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"

is often seized upon to become the name by which the child is known

<h3 class="main">3. <i>Marriage.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">A. The marriage
contract.</span> From certain scattered scraps of information on the
subject that have incidentally come to the writer&rsquo;s knowledge
during the past forty years, it would seem that <i>marriage by
capture</i> was largely, if not universally, in vogue among the
Kach&aacute;ris in earlier days. Some traces of this practice would
seem to survive in the ordinary marriage ceremonial which still to a
large extent holds the field. A case somewhat of this character came to
the writer&rsquo;s knowledge some twenty-five or thirty years ago. A
young Kach&aacute;ri, employed as a village pandit some thirty miles
from Tezpur, carried off a girl from the house of her parents some ten
miles away. No actual violence apparently occurred in the matter, and
very likely there had existed for some time previously a private
understanding between the two young people concerned. But what was done
clearly had not the approval of the girl&rsquo;s parents; for these
latter laid a complaint on the subject before the writer, and claimed
redress for the wrong done to them. When the offending pandit was
called to account for his conduct, he simply pleaded in defence that
what he had done was quite in accordance with the time-honoured custom
of his forefathers: and on payment of the usual bride-price, at a
somewhat enhanced rate, the parents raised no further objection to
their daughter&rsquo;s union with the pandit.</p>
<p>But in modern times &ldquo;marriage by capture&rdquo; is rapidly
passing out of vogue, if indeed it be not already absolutely a thing of
the past; and the marriage contract is usually entered into in one of
the four following ways:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The young people occasionally take the matter into their
own hands, as in the case above mentioned, ignoring the wishes of their
parents on either side. This procedure is looked upon by the community
as blameworthy and irregular, but not invalid. The bride&rsquo;s
parents claim an immediate payment of Rs. 5/- from the bridegroom, and
also exact the bride-price at a higher rate than usual. But if these
conditions are duly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>complied with, no further objections are as a
rule made to the union.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The more usual practice is as follows. When the son of
the house attains a marriageable age, <i>i.e.</i>, from fifteen to
twenty years, his parents at once set to work to find a suitable bride
for him. Having made their choice, they pay a visit to the prospective
bride&rsquo;s parents, taking with them certain presents in the form of
rice, liquor, betel-nuts, &amp;c., and formally ask the
daughter&rsquo;s hand for their son. If the presents are accepted by
the girl&rsquo;s parents, it is assumed that the proposal is favourably
received, and the respective parents at <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2308" title="Source: one">once</span> proceed to settle the
amount of the bride-price (<i>g&aacute;dhan</i>),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2314src" href="#xd26e2314" name="xd26e2314src">12</a> which is
always paid by the bridegroom&rsquo;s family to the parents of the
bride. In Darrang the amount so paid rarely exceeds Rs. 40/- to Rs.
60/-, though in Kamrup and Goalpara it is said to be often double these
sums; and even larger still among the R&aacute;bh&aacute;s,
Saraniy&aacute;s, &amp;c. In paying this formal visit to the
prospective bride&rsquo;s parents, those of the bridegroom are always
accompanied by some of the elders or leading men of their own village,
these latter acting as witnesses of the marriage contract, and so
constituting in their own persons a very effective, if irregular,
system of marriage registration. The stipulated
&ldquo;bride-price&rdquo; need not be paid at once, nor does the actual
union take place for some months after the marriage-contract has been
entered into. And in no case does the bride leave her parents&rsquo;
home until puberty has been attained; so that the manifold and obvious
evils inseparable from the system of infant betrothals, and the
prohibition of the marriage of child-widows among the higher castes of
Hindus, happily find no place whatever in the more wholesome domestic
life of the Kach&aacute;ris.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) In cases where the bridegroom or his parents are unable
to pay the bride-price demanded by the girl&rsquo;s parents, it is
usual for the young man to give the equivalent in personal service in
the house of the bride&rsquo;s parents, much as Jacob<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2325src" href="#xd26e2325" name="xd26e2325src">13</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>served in Laban&rsquo;s house seven years for
Rachel. The period of service is a matter of arrangement between the
parents of the parties concerned, and seems to vary greatly,
<i>i.e.</i>, from three or four to upwards of twelve or fifteen years.
Cohabitation, however, is allowed after about twelve or eighteen
months&rsquo; service, and at the conclusion of the full period, the
young people are free to depart whithersoever they will, though they
usually return to the house of the bridegroom&rsquo;s parents. This
form of service is known commonly as &ldquo;<i>Ola&oacute;
ghar-jiy&aacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) A modification of the above form of service is that which
is known as &ldquo;<i>m&aacute;l ghar-jiya</i>&rdquo; (Darrang) or
&ldquo;<i>Khasrot-th&aacute;ka ghar-jiya</i>&rdquo; (Kamrup). In this
case the prospective bridegroom severs all connection with his own
family, and identifies himself completely with that of his bride, in
whose house he serves until the death of her parents, when with his
wife he is entitled to the whole or the usual share of their property.
On that of his own parents or relatives he retains no claim
whatever.</p>
<p>The actual ceremony of marriage among the Kach&aacute;ris can
perhaps hardly be looked upon as of a religious character, but must be
regarded as more of the nature of a social and festive gathering. The
order of proceedings is somewhat as follows:&mdash;On a fixed day a
party of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends, numbering some four or five
women and thirty or forty men, set out for the house of the
bride&rsquo;s parents or guardians. The bridegroom may himself
accompany the party but more frequently does not. The immediate object
of the journey is to bring the bride to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house.
The party take with them nine loads of viands, <i>i.e.</i>, two men
carry a pig, other two a large jar containing rice-liquor, four men
carry loads of <i>t&aacute;mal-pan</i>, whilst the last man carries a
quantity of eatables meant for the men and cowherds, who, it is
supposed, might otherwise attempt to prevent the marriage party from
reaching the bride&rsquo;s house. Two women called <i>bairati</i> are
in charge of these materials for the wedding feast.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2361src" href="#xd26e2361" name="xd26e2361src">14</a> On
reaching the bride&rsquo;s house her people pour freely on the whole
party an irritating liquid known as <i>kachu p&aacute;ni</i> (water
mixed with the juice of the <i>kachu</i> plant) and to this somewhat
rough welcome the bridegroom&rsquo;s party are bound <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>to
submit without complaining, although the liquid causes much irritation
to, and even blisters, the skin. Finally the good things brought by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party are taken charge of by the bride&rsquo;s
people, and the wedding feast is forthwith duly prepared. The village
elders sit in front of the assembly, often a large one, and the younger
people behind, each guest having in front of him either a brass plate
or (more usually) a plantain leaf. On each of these plates the bride
places a quantity of rice and curry, serving the elders first; and when
all are duly provided for she makes obeisance to the assembled company,
and sometimes kneels in their midst for their sanction and approval on
entering upon the duties of married life, her husband when present
kneeling with her. Then one of the village elders, acting as Deori,
makes a short address on the obligations of the married state, ending
by wishing every blessing, &amp;c., to the newly wedded pair, the whole
assembly joining in at the end with one voice &ldquo;<i>er&#335;ina
z&aacute;thang</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;so may it be,&rdquo;
(Amen). The rest of the day is spent in feasting and merry-making, but
towards evening the bride is formally taken to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house. If on the journey she has to cross a river, road, or embankment
(<i>&aacute;li</i>), &amp;c., she is given at each such crossing nine
areca nuts and nine pan-leaves as presents to overcome her assumed
reluctance to proceed further. (Perhaps another relic of the
&ldquo;marriage by capture&rdquo; practice.) Before the bride enters
the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, those who bring her are entitled to
receive a jar of molasses as well as one of rice-liquor, and are
hospitably entertained for the night. It is said that Kach&aacute;ri
custom sanctions a certain interval of time, sometimes amounting to
five days, between the bride&rsquo;s entering her husband&rsquo;s house
and the consummation of the marriage. All expenses attending the
marriage festival, which may extend to Rs. 200/- and upwards, are borne
by the family of the bridegroom, the bride&rsquo;s people as a rule
contributing nothing.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Immediately after death occurs, the corpse is
carefully washed by the nearest relatives, the arms and legs
straightened out, the head anointed with oil, and the hair reverently
combed. A fowl or a pigeon is killed, and from its flesh a curry is
prepared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>with vegetables and condiments. A portion of this
food is then placed close by the deceased&rsquo;s head, and the act of
feeding him with a little of it is carried out up to a certain point,
though no food is as a matter of fact actually placed within his lips.
This act is repeated some ten or twelve times, and what remains of the
curry, &amp;c., is then thrown away, no one being allowed to consume
it. The dead man&rsquo;s body is then clothed with the best garments he
owned in his lifetime, and the whole covered with a perfectly new
cloth; and in this condition it is taken outside the homestead for
final disposal.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disposal of the dead.</span> There are two
recognised way of disposing of the dead, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) Burial and
(2) Cremation. The latter is looked upon as the more correct and
respectable, though from motives of economy the former is by far the
more common. <span class="marginnote">1. Burial</span>When burial is
decided upon the corpse is carried to its last resting place, which is
often but not always on the banks of a running stream, by the nearest
surviving relatives, no women being permitted to attend. Should it be
necessary for the burial party to cross a river or irrigation canal, a
cord is usually stretched from bank to bank at the crossing place,
either above or below the water, to serve a kind of bridge for the
spirit (<i>jiwa</i>), should he be at any time disposed to revisit the
scenes amid which his earthly life has been passed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2405src" href="#xd26e2405" name="xd26e2405src">15</a> Arrived
at a suitable place (there are no recognised cemeteries for the
interment), some pice are thrown on the spot, to purchase the ground
from the deity (<i>mad&aacute;i</i>) to whom it is supposed to belong.
The body is laid on the ground and the grave duly dug, but before
placing the corpse therein, the friends and relatives make a solemn
procession around it, five times in the case of a man and seven in that
of a woman. The body is then placed in the grave, a somewhat shallow
one, and the nearest relatives proceed to fill it with earth. In
carrying out this process a certain precaution is taken, <i>i.e.</i>, a
hollow reed or a stalk of jungle grass (<i>kher</i>) is placed
perpendicularly in the grave extending from the nose of the deceased to
a point somewhat above the natural level of the ground; and in filling
the grave with earth, great care is taken not to injure or displace
this reed, so that the deceased&rsquo;s spirit may be able to breathe
should he so desire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>After filling the grave four posts are
erected over it, one at each corner; and threads passed around them, in
order to prevent the spirits of other men from interfering with the
repose of the deceased. In the case of well-to-do people a certain
number of rupees are usually buried with the corpse, and even the
poorer classes make offerings of pice, &amp;c., for this pious purpose;
whilst brass and other utensils needed in every-day life are almost
always left on the grave, it being supposed that the deceased may
require the use of these things in the new state of existence on which
he has recently entered. Finally, a rough shed of thatch is put up
close by the grave to shelter the deceased&rsquo;s spirit from rain and
sun.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">2. Cremation.</span> Very much the same
procedure is in vogue in the case of cremation, which is looked upon as
the more respectable method of disposing of the dead among the
wealthier members of the community. Cremation usually takes place on or
near the banks of running streams, and is prefaced by the formal buying
of the land from the deity (<i>mad&aacute;i</i>) of the locality. Here
too a certain difference is made in disposing of the corpse of a man
and of a woman respectively; for in the case of a woman <i>seven</i>
layers of wood are placed under the body and seven above it, whilst in
dealing with a man&rsquo;s corpse <i>five</i> such layers under and
five above the body are held to be sufficient. After placing the body
on the funeral pile, the deceased&rsquo;s friends and relatives pass
round it in procession, <i>five</i> times in the case of a man and
<i>seven</i> in that of a woman (see above). The funeral pile is then
set on fire on all four sides at once, and the fire carefully fed until
every vestige of the deceased&rsquo;s body is consumed. The ashes are
not carried away, but four posts are usually placed in the ground
enclosing the oblong space on which the cremation has been carried out;
and on the tops of these a cloth is spread, which is held to shelter
the spirit of the deceased from sun and rain.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Indications of belief in life after
death.</span> From what has been written above, it would certainly seem
that the Kach&aacute;ri has some idea, however vague and
unsatisfactory, of a life prolonged after the great change we commonly
call &ldquo;death,&rdquo; though his notion of the future life is
merely that of the &ldquo;first (earthly) life renewed.&rdquo; It has
obviously little or nothing in common with the hope of life eternal in
Christ, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>life <i>in</i> God, life <i>with</i> God,
life <i>like</i> God, given us in the New Testament (see 1 Cor. xv.;
Phil. iii. 20, 21; 1 John iii. 2).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Festivities.<br>
1. Domestic.</span> From such information as the writer has been able
to ascertain, there would seem to be few well-marked domestic
festivities among the Kach&aacute;ris, though the race is a very
sociable and hospitable one, and the people entertain each other freely
and frequently.</p>
<p>The two following may perhaps be mentioned:&mdash;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;<i lang="brx">Mikham gad&aacute;n
z&aacute;n&aacute;i</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the &ldquo;eating of the
new rice.&rdquo; This is a feast held about December 10th (there is
apparently no fixed date), in celebration of the commencement of the
cutting of the great rice crop of the year (<i lang="brx">s&aacute;li
dh&aacute;n</i>). It is on this occasion that the proceeds of the newly
harvested rice are first partaken of as an actual article of food.
There is perhaps nothing of a religious character about it, its main
feature being a very free consumption of rice-beer, often resulting in
much drunkenness.</p>
<p>B. &ldquo;<i lang="brx">Mahu hanai</i>&rdquo; (or <i lang=
"brx">th&agrave;mfoi hasa-nai K</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the driving
away of mosquitoes.&rdquo; This is a form of merry-making got up mainly
by the young people of a village about the latter part of November or
early in December, to celebrate the departure of the mosquito plague
for the cold season. Some twenty-five years ago the writer was passing
the night in a school-shed, and was aroused from sleep by much
shouting, dancing, &amp;c., just outside the door. On looking out into
the moonlight he saw a group of fantastic figures, some of them clothed
in dry plantain leaves, and wearing a head-dress made of thatch of
preposterous proportions resembling an enormous conical-shaped
&ldquo;dunce cap.&rdquo; On inquiring the reason of the gathering, he
was told that the performers were &ldquo;driving away the
mosquitoes.&rdquo; No doubt this is an amusement got up by the younger
members of the community, who are sometimes rewarded for their efforts
by small gifts of money, food, &amp;c., from their elders (<i>cf.</i>
&ldquo;Guy Fawkes,&rdquo; at home).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">2. Tribal.</span> There would seem to be no
distinctively tribal festivals characteristic of the Kach&aacute;ris of
this district (Darrang), unless the January and April <i>Bihus</i> can
be regarded as such. The origin of these two festivals is still
somewhat obscure and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>uncertain, and further light on the subject
is greatly to be desired. Certainly they are not <i>exclusively</i>
Kach&aacute;ri festivals, for they are observed by the Hindus in this
neighbourhood as well as by the Kach&aacute;ris.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2505src" href="#xd26e2505" name="xd26e2505src">16</a> Among the
latter the January Bihu is usually celebrated about the 12th of that
month. For weeks previously the young people have been busy building
&ldquo;Bihu huts&rdquo; of jungle thatch; also in erecting tall
bamboos, sometimes surmounted by ragged flags, &amp;c., while straw,
thatch and other combustibles are piled up around these bamboos to the
height of many feet. On the appointed Bihu night these sheds, &amp;c.,
are all set fire to amid much rejoicing, dancing, singing, &amp;c., and
of course there is, as on all like occasions, a liberal consumption of
the national rice-beer. For a month or two previously to this festival,
the village boys and young people have had to guard the growing and
ripening rice crops night and day; and in all likelihood this
merry-making, which is very much of the nature of a &ldquo;Harvest
home,&rdquo; is largely an expression of their joy and gladness at
being relieved from this hard and irksome duty.</p>
<p>The April Bihu, the origin of which it is not so easy to account
for, seem to be a &ldquo;Saturnalia&rdquo; of much more objectionable
character. The people abandon themselves freely both to drunkenness and
other forms of licentiousness, and cases of serious assault and riot
have been known to accompany and follow these gatherings. Among the
Darrang Kach&aacute;ris, this festival lasts for seven days, during
which little or no work is done, the whole period being given up to
merry-making, dancing, feasting, &amp;c. As is the practice among their
Hindu neighbours, on the opening day all cattle are taken to the
nearest river or tank, and there formally bathed, and afterwards
sprinkled with a preparation compounded of rice-beer (<i>zu</i>),
tomatoes, and turmeric. The horns are smeared with oil, and
occasionally oil, ashes, and pounded rice-flour are applied in patches
to the bodies of the cattle. This duty discharged, the people abandon
themselves to sheer merriment, the younger folks especially giving
themselves up to dancing and singing, &amp;c. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>The
verses sung at these festivals seem for the most part to be little
better than mere meaningless jingle-jangle rhymes, made up on the spur
of the moment, though occasionally some of them give an insight into
the peculiar humour of the Kach&aacute;ri character and temperament.
One or two samples of what is sung at these gatherings are given
below:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The above represents an exchange of playful banter
between two members (brother and sister) of a Kach&aacute;ri family who
are about to take part in a Bihu festival or some similar merry-making.
The brother, Pu&aacute; R&aacute;m, with all a young man&rsquo;s
impatience and eagerness to enjoy the fun, calls to his sister,
Boisagi, to come out from the house and join him at once, while she
from within (couplet two) pleads womanlike for a few minutes longer
grace to complete her personal adornment. Both brother and sister then
join in calling on a near relative, a <i>mauzad&aacute;r</i>, not to
shirk his social responsibilities, but at once to provide the ways and
means for a plentiful Bihu feast. The general sense of the three
couplets, somewhat freely translated, is given below:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">1. Sister Boisagi, come out and play;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following couplet, which is not connected with the
foregoing, calls perhaps for some explanation. The words, of which a
free translation is appended, are supposed to be uttered by a
Kach&aacute;ri damsel, the village belle, to a fickle lover, who, after
paying court to her for a time, deserts her and marries another. The
faithless swain is a man of some little importance in the village
community as a <i>d&#257;ng d&#257;liy&#257;</i>, or drum-major, one of
his functions being to beat the big drum (<i>madal</i>) at all
festivals, marriage processions, &amp;c. He has the misfortune to lose
his wife after a month or two of wedded life, and then would fain
return to the &ldquo;old love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed therefore with his big drum of office and apparelled in his
gayest attire, he presents himself before the Kach&aacute;ri belle and
renews his suit for her hand. Now the average Kach&aacute;ri maiden has
a wholesome sense of her own value (in married life she is not
unfrequently the &ldquo;better man&rdquo; of the two), and no more
relishes being &ldquo;jilted&rdquo; than her sisters in other and more
civilised parts of the world. She at once, therefore, repels his
advances in the most positive and unqualified way; and not only so, but
in the presence of a large bevy of scornful village maidens, all highly
resentful of the faithless lover&rsquo;s fickleness, she proceeds to
pour contempt on his suit in the following severely sarcastic couplet
(&rdquo;<span lang="la">facit indignatio
versus</span>&rdquo;):&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">D&aacute;ng-d&aacute;liy&aacute;,
d&aacute;ngd&aacute;liy&aacute;.</p>
<p class="line">Moz&aacute;ng moz&aacute;ng
g&aacute;n-bl&aacute;-ba</p>
<p class="line">N&aacute;ng-kho n&aacute;ng-li-y&aacute;;
nang-li-y&aacute;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Handsome raiment though you wear,</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m not for you, I do declare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">(The original Kach&aacute;ri verse is singularly
emphatic.)</p>
<p>Or</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;You come to me in bright array:</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m not for you; be off, I say.</p>
<p class="line">This dandy swain my mate would be?</p>
<p class="line">No &lsquo;second-hand lover,&rsquo; girls, for
me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The above couplets may perhaps be fairly looked upon
as typical illustrations of the Kach&aacute;ri temperament and
character, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>and it may be inferred from them that human nature
among this interesting race does not greatly differ from human nature
in other and more civilised countries of the world.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be added that whilst the Garos living in the plains
observe both the January and the April Bihus<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2630" title="Not in source">,</span> their brethren in the Hills
ignore both, though they would seem to have certain special harvest
festivals of their own. The people of the North Cachar Hills, on the
other hand, seem to observe only one annual Bihu, of the nature of a
harvest home, at any time between October and December. These
Kach&aacute;ri festivals are almost always attended by an immoderate
consumption of the national rice-beer, not to say by actual drunkenness
in not a few cases. On the other hand, they have their good side in
that they help to keep the people to some extent beyond the influence
of the destructive vortex of Hinduism, in which their simple primitive
virtues might otherwise be so readily engulfed, and the adoption of
which in whole or in part is invariably accompanied by a grave and
deep-seated deterioration in conduct and character. <span class=

<p class="first">On this section of the subject there is no need to
dwell at any length; indeed, materials for the purpose are to a great
extent wanting. Of traditions, properly so called, whether historical
or otherwise, the Kach&aacute;ris of this district would seem to be
almost absolutely destitute. Nor can they be regarded as a
superstitious race, for it is only when suffering from a serious
outbreak of cholera, <i>K&aacute;l&aacute;-az&aacute;r</i>, or other
like public calamity, that they make frequent, and sometimes costly,
offerings to their deities as shown in some detail in the preceding
section. As a rule the people are of a bright, cheerful disposition;
and as a planter friend once remarked to the writer, of all the various
races employed on his extensive tea estates the Kach&aacute;ris were
the only people who might be frequently heard whistling merrily as they
went to and from their daily toil. Moreover, the subject of
Kach&aacute;ri folk-lore has already been effectively dealt with by a
writer fully competent to do it ample justice; and perhaps the objects
aimed at in this section will be best attained by re-issuing three or
four of the more characteristic and typical of the interesting series
of Kach&aacute;ri folk-tales collected by this writer, some fifteen
years since, from an intelligent member of the Kach&aacute;ri race
still (1906) resident in this district (Darrang).<a class="noteref" id=

the god of riches, and taking from him seedlings of paddy, pulse,
mustard, and gourds, journeyed for eight days and so reached his home.
And after staying a couple of days he set forth to cultivate, taking
dry food with him. And first he marked out a piece of rich land by
placing boundaries on all four sides of it, and so came home. And again
he set out another day with hoe and axe, and cut and burned the jungle,
and cleaned the soil, and after worshipping <span class=

<p>And when all was ready, the old man planted his seedlings of various
sorts, and finally went home and rested. And so, as time went by, the
old woman desired vehemently to see how the crops were getting on. But
the old man said, &ldquo;There is no water on the road, and if you grow
athirst you will get no relief.&rdquo; But she persisted and prevailed,
and made her husband take her along. And as they went and were now
quite close to her husband&rsquo;s field, behold, the old woman began
to be very thirsty. And the old man, being enraged, cried &ldquo;What
did I tell you? There is no water and yet you would come.&rdquo; But
she, being a woman, said &ldquo;If you do not give me to drink I shall
die. So water you must procure as best you can.&rdquo; So the old man,
seeing no other way, went to seek for water. And after long search,
seeing a tank, he bound the old woman&rsquo;s eyes with a cloth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57b" href="#pb57b" name=

said to her, &ldquo;Drink if you will, but look not upon the
tank.&rdquo; Now the ducks and other water-fowl were playing in the
water, and were making a merry noise, clacking and quacking. And, the
old woman being curious, like all her sex, peeped at them. And, seeing
them at their play, she too desired to be happy in her husband&rsquo;s
society, and, though he was very loth, prevailed with him. And so in
due course there were born to them many sons and daughters. And then,
in order to provide for their food, he journeyed to the
Him&aacute;layas and digged a great tank, stocked with many kinds of
fishes.</p>

<p>Now, one day the god Sri, the god of good luck, came that way with
his white dog, a-hunting for deer and hares and tortoises. And when he
came to the margin of the tank, behold he was very thirsty. But when he
stooped to drink, the fishes said to him eagerly that he must grant
them a boon in return for their water. To which he assented; and when
he had satisfied his thirst, the fishes said, &ldquo;Take us to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58b" href="#pb58b" name=
"pb58b">58</a>]</span>great river, the Brahmaputra (or Lohit).&rdquo;
So the god Sri tied them to his staff, and drew them after him, making
runnels of water. And that is how the rivers were made. And the fishes
in return gave him a pumpkin and a gourd. And, taking these with him to
a friend&rsquo;s house, his friend regaled him with rice-beer and
pig&rsquo;s flesh; and in the morning he gave his friend the pumpkin.
But when his friend cut open the pumpkin, it contained nothing but pure
silver. So he bade the god Sri stay another day, and brewed fresh beer
and killed another pig, and when he was going away gave him a flitch of
bacon to take with him. So the god Sri gave him also the gourd. But
when he cut open the gourd, it contained nothing but pure gold. And so
the god Sri journeyed to his home. And when he got there, he found that
his little daughter was very ill. And that was because he had given
away the presents which the fishes had made him. But the fishes took
pity on him, and came to him in the guise of physicians, and told him
that if he would worship and do sacrifice on the banks of rivers, then
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59b" href="#pb59b" name=

is why we Kach&aacute;ris worship rivers. And that is all.</p>

<p class="first">There was once a very lazy boy. And when everybody
else had planted out his paddy, he was only setting forth to plough.
But the old man of the season, seeing him, said &ldquo;The season has

it is late.&rdquo; But the boy would not listen to him, and ploughed

you.&rdquo; And the boy said &ldquo;Speak quickly then, and have done
with it.&rdquo; And the old man said, &ldquo;My son, the season is
gone; what avails it to plough now?&rdquo; And then the boy cried
&ldquo;Where has it gone? And when has it gone? And why has it gone?
And how shall I find it?&rdquo; But the old man of the season said,
&ldquo;You should have ploughed when others did. The season has gone,
and no man can bring it back.&rdquo; But the boy said, &ldquo;I must
bring it back; else, how shall I eat, and how shall I live? Do tell me
where it is gone.&rdquo; And as he would not let the god go, finally,
losing patience, he said &ldquo;You go over there, and you will find an
old man with a snow-white head ploughing in a field. You get hold of
him and do as he tells you.&rdquo; So saying, he made his escape. Then
the lad hastened home to his mother and bade her cook supper quickly,
and tie <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61b" href="#pb61b" name=
"pb61b">61</a>]</span>him up some rice to take with him on the morrow,
for he was going to bring back the departed season for ploughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when I was ploughing to-day, an
old man told me that the season was gone, and that if I went after him
and pursued him I would find him, and that I must do as he would tell
me.&rdquo; So she rose very early in the morning, and, giving him to
eat and drink, sent him on his way. And as he went, he asked all he met
&ldquo;Can you tell me where the old man of the season has gone?&rdquo;
But they said, &ldquo;Everyone knows that the season is gone, but where
it is gone, or why it is gone, who can say?&rdquo; At last, when he was
nearly in despair, he saw an old man ploughing afar off, and shouted to
him &ldquo;Stay a moment, father, stay; I want to ask you a
question.&rdquo; But the old man was busy, and went his way. Then the
lad pursued him and never ceased calling after him till at last the old
man losing patience, turned upon him, and said, &ldquo;What
pertinacious noisy lad is this, who won&rsquo;t leave me alone?&rdquo;
But the lad said, &ldquo;Be not angry, my father; I am fallen into
great trouble, and it behoves you to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62b" href="#pb62b" name="pb62b">62</a>]</span>help me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Speak quickly, then,&rdquo; said the old man. And the boy said,
&ldquo;I take you to be the old man of the season, and I pray you not
to slay me. All the others have planted out their paddy, and I have
fallen behind, and have planted nothing. Therefore, unless you turn
back, I cannot hope to get any harvest.&rdquo; But the old man said,
&ldquo;It is too late for me to return. Go you back, and plant your
paddy as best you can.&rdquo; And so the lad hastened back and planted
out his seedlings in such heedless haste as became him. And
that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p class="first">By his Hindu neighbours the Kach&aacute;ri is often
looked upon as a B&oelig;otian, a simpleton from whom little in the way
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>intelligent action is to be expected. And
undoubtedly in the matter of mere book-learning he is never likely to
take a very high place, nor will he shine brightly in the
examination-room as an ordinary competitor. On the other hand, he is
often endowed with certain practical qualities which are of great value
to him in the battle of life. He usually has no small share of what is
well called &ldquo;the <i>saving</i> sense of <i>humour</i>,&rdquo;
which prevents him from taking himself too seriously, and does not a
little to lighten for him the cares and toils of life. Of his
possession of this invaluable endowment many illustrations will be
found in the collection of Kach&aacute;ri Folk-tales, &amp;c., referred
to above, a volume which the curious in such matters will do well to
consult. And in addition to his sense of humour, he has often a goodly
supply of sound homely <i>mother wit</i>, which stands him in good
stead when brought into relations with other men, who from a merely
intellectual point of view are undoubtedly his superiors. These, and
other like endowments of great price, often enable him to seize with
unerring instinct on the weak points of an opponent&rsquo;s position
and to avail himself of them with no little dexterity and success. In
the following amusing story, for instance, the simple (?)
Kach&aacute;ri servant completely outwits his astute Br&aacute;hmin
master, turning the tables on the latter to his no small dismay and
discomfiture.</p>

<p class="first">There was once a Br&aacute;hmin who had a servant. And
one day when they were going to the house of the Br&aacute;hmin&rsquo;s
mother-in-law, the Br&aacute;hmin gave his servant a bunch of plantains
and other things to carry, and said to him, &ldquo;Now, mind you
don&rsquo;t eat those plantains, for I can see just as well behind as I
can in front.&rdquo; And, so saying, he marched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64b" href="#pb64b" name=
"pb64b">64</a>]</span>ahead. And presently the servant, getting hungry
plucked one of the plantains from the bunch, and, holding it out to his
master&rsquo;s back, ate it. And this he did again and again till all
the plantains were gone. And when the Br&aacute;hmin presently asked
what had become of the load, the servant said, &ldquo;You told me you
could see behind as well as in front. So I showed you each plantain
before I ate it. And you never said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Br&aacute;hmin went his way speechless. Presently they
stopped to cook their midday meal, and they had got with them a few
<i>khawai</i> fish. But the Br&aacute;hmin gave only one to his
servant, and kept the rest himself. And when he was about to eat, the
servant asked innocently &ldquo;Oh! Br&aacute;hmin, do <i>khawai</i>
fish swim about singly or in shoals?&rdquo; To which the Br&aacute;hmin
said, &ldquo;Why, in shoals, of course.&rdquo; So the servant said,
&ldquo;Then my fish had better go with yours.&rdquo; And, so saying, he
threw his fish on the Br&aacute;hmin&rsquo;s mess, which was defiled.
So the Br&aacute;hmin got no dinner, and the servant ate the whole.</p>

<p>And so in various ways the Br&aacute;hmin was put to shame by his
servant. So he wrote a long letter to his brother, and putting it in
his servant&rsquo;s hand, bade him deliver it. But he went a little
way, until he met a man who could read and write, and he bade him tell
him what was written in the letter. And the man read him the letter,
which was to the effect that the brother was to kill the servant. On
this, the servant tore up the letter and bade his friend write another
one, saying: &ldquo;Dear brother, on receipt of this letter

<p class="first">There was once a king who had one son and one
daughter. The son&rsquo;s name was R&aacute;on&aacute; and the
daughter&rsquo;s R&aacute;oni. As they gradually grew up together,
R&aacute;on&aacute; wished to marry his sister. One day
R&aacute;on&aacute; remained alone in an outhouse unknown to his
father; and when the latter wished his son to come to dinner, the young
man could not be found. However, a servant saw the youth in the
outhouse and told the king, who going to the boy asked him what was the
matter. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you want an elephant, I
will give you an elephant; if you want a horse, I will give you a
horse; but do not abandon yourself to sorrow in this way.&rdquo; And
then R&aacute;on&aacute; replied, &ldquo;I am in no special want of
anything, but if you give me a promise on oath, I will tell you what is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69b" href="#pb69b" name=
"pb69b">69</a>]</span>the matter.&rdquo; Thereupon, the king, seeing
that there was no help for it, took an oath saying, &ldquo;Whatever you
want, I will give it to you.&rdquo; And then R&aacute;on&aacute; said,
&ldquo;Give me permission to marry R&aacute;oni, and then I will eat my
food.&rdquo; On hearing this the king was sorely troubled in his mind;
but remembering the terms of his oath, he took steps to bring about the
marriage, at the same time forbidding anyone to mention the matter to
R&aacute;oni, who, therefore, heard nothing about the proposed marriage
with herself. But one day R&aacute;oni went to the village stream to
clean the rice for the daily meals, when an old woman met her and
inquired, &ldquo;What is going on in the palace to-day?&rdquo; And
R&aacute;oni replied, &ldquo;The son of the house is to be married
to-day.&rdquo; And when the old lady asked further &ldquo;But to whom
is he to be married?&rdquo; R&aacute;oni replied, &ldquo;Mother, I
cannot say.&rdquo; And then said the old dame, &ldquo;R&aacute;oni, it
is you that he is going to marry.&rdquo; And when R&aacute;oni
inquired, &ldquo;Mother, can this be true?&rdquo; the old woman took an
oath to confirm what she had said. And then R&aacute;oni at once flew
right away up into the sky, and when R&aacute;on&aacute; saw
R&aacute;oni thus flying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70b" href=
"#pb70b" name="pb70b">70</a>]</span>away, he shouted after her, doing
his utmost to catch her. It is these loud shouts and threats of
R&aacute;on&aacute; that men call &ldquo;thunder&rdquo;; and when
R&aacute;oni occasionally looks back to see if her pursuer is gaining
upon her, she in so doing reveals for an instant the brightness and
beauty of her face, glowing like fire; and it is this bright, dazzling
beauty of her countenance that men call &ldquo;lightning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hence during a thunder storm may sometimes be heard the words
&ldquo;<span lang="brx">R&aacute;onikho R&aacute;onai&aacute;
has&ugrave;dang</span>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;R&aacute;on&aacute;
is chasing R&aacute;oni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not impossible that the foregoing story may be a
Kach&aacute;ri version, greatly altered, of a well-known episode told
at length in the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana, <i>i.e.</i> the abduction of
Sit&aacute; by R&aacute;vana the demon-king of Ceylon. The name
R&aacute;vana in a slightly altered form (R&aacute;on&aacute;) is not
unknown among the Kach&aacute;ris of this district (Darrang). About
four or five miles south-west of the Ud&aacute;lguri
Th&aacute;n&aacute; there are still existing the remains of a very fine
earthwork road, known to this day as &ldquo;Rowana&rsquo;s
embankment&rdquo; (R&aacute;vanagarh), which gives its name to the
Mauz&aacute; in which it is situated. The construction of this
earthwork must have involved a large outlay of labour, but the
tradition about it is that it was thrown up in a single night by
R&aacute;vana and his followers, the R&aacute;khshases, Asurs,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;Among the Kach&aacute;ris of the North Kach&aacute;r
Hills, the mode of accounting for thunder and lightning is very
different from that given above, though towards the end of the account
given by the late Mr. Soppitt<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2939src" href=

<p class="first">The mother tongue of the B&aring;r&aring; race at
least as spoken in this (Darrang) district undoubtedly belongs to the
&ldquo;Agglutinative&rdquo; as distinct from the Inflexional family of
languages. Here and there, perhaps, certain slight traces of inflexion
may be found, but even these are doubtful and in any case very rare,
indeed where they exist at all it may perhaps be assumed that they have
been adopted with some obvious modifications from the speech of their
Assamese and Bengali neighbours.</p>
<p>In the following pages only a very slight outline sketch of
Kach&aacute;ri Grammar is attempted, as the writer has already dealt
with the subject at some length over twenty years ago,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2956src" href="#xd26e2956" name="xd26e2956src">1</a>
and most of the conclusions then arrived at still hold good, so far as
the Kach&aacute;ris of Darrang are concerned. But it is hoped that what
little is given here may be of service to those who may have occasion
to learn and make use of this language in after years. No attempt is
made to draw any clear or well defined line between Accidence and
Syntax, for these two closely allied branches of the subject may be
best studied together by the use of certain illustrative sentences
which to the attentive reader will give an insight into the structure
of the language, whilst at the same time doing something to supply him
with a useful vocabulary of words and phrases. <span class=

<p>(<i>a</i>) The possessive case has two signs, the former (ni) being
by far the more commonly used.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The ablative case ending is a compound one, as its proper
sign (frai) is preceded by that of the genitive, ni. The same remark
holds good sometimes with the locative case.</p>

which a very short vowel is attached, so short indeed that in rapid
speaking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>the vowel of the first syllable may not be heard
at all, whilst in composition this first syllable is sometimes omitted
altogether, as <span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class=
"top">&ldquo;m&aacute;nsoia</span> <span lang="en" class=
"bottom">man</span></span> <span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class=

he?).</span></span> <span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class=
"top">H&aacute;m-go.</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">Good (he)
is.</span></span></p>
<p>2. In composition the adjective usually, though not invariably,
follows the noun it qualifies, as <span class="intra"><span lang="brx"
class="top">D&#335;ima ga-s&uacute;m.</span> <span lang="en" class=
"bottom">(The) water black = (k&aacute;l&aacute;

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">3. Comparison.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is effected by appending the syllable
&ldquo;sari&rdquo; or &ldquo;khri&rdquo; (= than) to the word with
which comparison is made, this word being always in the dative case.
The superlative degree is denoted much in the same way, the noun being
preceded by some word signifying &ldquo;all,&rdquo; thus</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Bi &aacute;ng-n&#335;-khri g&#259;-zau&mdash;he (is)
taller than I (comparative).</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Bi b&#335;i-n&#259;-s&aacute;ri
ga-za&uacute;-sin&mdash;he is the tallest of all (superlative).</p>
<p>In making these comparisons the first syllable (ga) of the adjective
is often omitted: as <span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class=
"top">nang</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">you</span></span>
<span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class=
"top">&aacute;ng-n&#335;-khri</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">I

<h4 class="main">4. Numeral Adjectives.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The numerical system in this District is very
defective, only seven digits, <i>i.e.</i> s&egrave;, n&egrave;,
th&agrave;m, br&egrave; (br&#335;i), b&acirc;, r&aring; (d&aring;), sni
(s&#301;ni), being generally used, though the remaining three,
skh&oacute;, z&agrave;t, zi (zu), are occasionally recognised. There is
also a useful collective word za-khai = four, which when followed by
two numerals is to be multiplied by the former whilst the latter is to
be added to the product so obtained; thus</p>
<ul>
<li>zakhai-th&agrave;m s&agrave; th&agrave;m,</li>
<li>Four &times; three + three = fifteen (men).</li>
<li>Burma zakhai-br&egrave; m&aacute;-n&egrave;,</li>

</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before the second numeral are always inserted certain monosyllables,
which classify the noun referred to, <i>e.g.</i> as above, s&aacute;
(human beings) and m&aacute; (irrational animals). This classifying
syllable always indicates the point at which the multiplication ends
and the addition begins.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, there are no relative pronouns, though a form zi,
borrowed from Assamese, is sometimes heard. The place of the relative
pronoun is usually supplied by a participle, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;
<span class="intra"><span lang="brx" class="top">Mi-&aacute; nu-nai
mas&aacute; thoi-bai.</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">yesterday

<p class="first">In Kach&aacute;ri the verb undergoes no change to
express number or person, which are indicated by the subject alone. But
a slight trace of inflexion (euphonic) is perhaps found in the fact
that when a verbal root ends in a vowel and the termination begins with
one, a disagreeable hiatus is avoided by inserting the letter <i>i</i>
between the two, thus:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Th&aacute;ng-&#259;&mdash;I go.</li>
<li>Nu-i-&#335;&mdash;I see.</li>

<p>3. The Passive voice is not very frequently used. Its tenses,
&amp;c., are expressed by conjugating the verb z&aacute;-n&#335;, to
be, with the past participle of the verb, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Ang b&uacute;-nai z&aacute;-gan&mdash;I beaten
be-shall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. The <i>causal</i> verb is formed in two ways. The more idiomatic
method is to prefix the letter <i>f</i> (with any euphonic vowel) to
the principal verb, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellLeft cellTop xd26e763">Ang</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellTop xd26e3440"><img src=

<td class="cellTop">rang-dang</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellTop xd26e763">&mdash;I</td>
<td class="cellRight cellTop">understand,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">f&#259;-rang-dang</td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom"><i>cause</i> to understand, I
teach.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellLeft cellTop xd26e763">Ang</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellTop xd26e3440"><img src=
"images/lbrace2.png" alt="" width="12" height="40"></td>
<td class="cellTop">s&#299;-gan</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellTop xd26e763">&mdash;I</td>
<td class="cellRight cellTop">become wet,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">fi s&#299;-gan</td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom">shall make wet, soak, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3569" title="Source: immense">immerse</span>.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>In the above it will be observed that the causal force lies in the
letter <i>f</i>, its vowel (always a very <i>short</i> one) being drawn
by attraction (euphonic) from that of the principal verb.</p>
<p>A second way of expressing causation is to combine the verb
h&#335;-n&#335;, to give, with the infinitive mood of the principal
verb, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellLeft cellTop xd26e763">Ang</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="rowspan cellTop xd26e3440"><img src=
"images/lbrace2.png" alt="" width="12" height="40"></td>
<td class="cellTop">rang-&#259;</td>
<td class="cellRight cellTop">I learn,</td>

<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">rang-n&#335; h&#335;-i-&#335;</td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom">I cause to learn, teach.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>5. The distinctive vowel of the negative verb is <i>&aacute;</i>,
which in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>some cases gives place to <i>i</i> or <i>e</i>,
probably for reasons of euphony. Its chief forms of tense and mood,
&amp;c., may be shown thus:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Present, B&uacute;-&aacute;&mdash;(I) am not beating.</li>
<li>Imperfect, B&uacute;-&aacute;-kh&#335;i-man.</li>

<p class="first">The great and characteristic feature of the Syntax of
the language is the remarkable way in which verbal roots, mostly
monosyllabic, are combined together to form a very large and useful
class of compound verbs. In this way the use of conjunctions &amp;c. is
very largely avoided, and the language becomes possessed of a vivid
force and picturesqueness often wanting in more cultivated tongues.
These compound verbs may perhaps be roughly classified under two
groups, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&mdash;Those in which each verbal root has a distinct meaning and
may be used separately;&mdash;</p>
<p>II.&mdash;Those in which one or more of the verbal roots is never

<p>From what little has been here stated it would seem to be fairly
obvious that the language in its original form is strictly an
agglutinative one. But a gradual process of deglutinisation has for
some time been going on, no doubt originating through intercourse with
neighbours speaking languages of quite another type, <i>e.g.</i>
Assamese, Bengali, &amp;c. Most Kach&aacute;ris (B&aring;r&aring;) in
this district are quite familiar with Assamese; indeed, it is very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>rarely that the writer has met with men who did
not know this form of Aryan speech. Now a Kach&aacute;ri in the habit
of speaking Assamese will, even when using his own mother tongue, to
which he is strongly attached, not infrequently resort to a partially
inflected form of expression instead of restricting himself to the use
of infixes, &amp;c. This gradual change in the language is especially
brought out in the usage of the participial forms of the verb. It has
been shown above, <i>e.g.</i> that the past participle (passive) can be
declined like a noun. Again, in expressing a simple sentence like the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I ran and caught and brought the horse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an Assamese speaking Kach&aacute;ri would probably make use of the
active participle in n&aacute;-n&#335;i; whilst his more primitive
brother, who might be less familiar with Assamese, would confine
himself to the more idiomatic use of infixes. Thus the sentence given
above might be expressed in two ways:</p>

<p>It would seem to be not improbable that the language may gradually
lose its agglutinative character, and approximate to the inflected
type, though the process most likely will be but a slow one, owing to
the very <i>clannish</i> temperament of the people which makes them
cling strongly to anything they regard as their very own, <i>e.g.</i>
their language (<i>cf.</i>, a somewhat similar state of things in Wales
and the Scottish Highlands). But in its present stage the language is
one of no small interest to the student of comparative philology,
because it is an apt illustration of a form of speech which, once
strictly agglutinative, is now in process of learning inflexion through
the pressure of contact with the speakers of Aryan tongues.<a class=

<h3 class="main">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">Tribes closely allied to
Kach&aacute;ris.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a former section, something has been said in favour
of the idea that the Kach&aacute;ri race is a much more widely
distributed one than was supposed to be the case some years ago; and
members of this race under different names still occupy large areas in
north-eastern India. It may be useful to add a few brief notes on some
of the principal of these closely cognate tribes, confining our notice
mainly to those points and details wherein they differ more or less
from the Kach&aacute;ris of Darrang, whose language, habits, religion,
etc., as described above, may perhaps be provisionally taken as a
standard.</p>
<p>1. <i>Garos.</i>&mdash;One of the most important of these allied
races is undoubtedly that known to us as the Garos, dwelling in what is
called the Garo Hills District. This tribe, like the people of the
North Cachar Hills, has until recent years been largely confined to the
part of Assam which bears it name, and has not come into contact with
Hinduism to any great extent, and hence it has in all likelihood
preserved its aboriginal manners and customs almost intact. But it is
not necessary here to do more than merely mention the name of this
interesting people, as their whole manner of life has been sufficiently
dealt with elsewhere by a highly competent hand.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4103src" href="#xd26e4103" name="xd26e4103src">1</a></p>
<p>2. <i>Mech (Mes).</i> 70,000.&mdash;Nor is it necessary to do much
more for the people known as Mech (<i>Mes</i>) who are undoubtedly
merely a branch (the western one) of the B&aring;r&aring;s of Darrang.
The name is almost certainly a corruption of the Sanskrit word mleccha,
<i>i.e.</i>, an outcast from the Brahmin point of view, a non-observer
of caste regulations; such persons being in the light of modern
Hinduism very much what the barbarian was to the Greek, or the
&ldquo;Gentile&rdquo; to the Jew, some twenty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>centuries ago. This term <i>mlech</i>
(<i>mech</i>) is not in use here (Darrang) or in Kamrup.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Subdivision.</span> The uncomplimentary
epithet &ldquo;<i>mlech padre</i>&rdquo; has sometimes been hurled at
the writer when preaching to Brahmins or other high caste Hindus,
though it would seem to be the recognised name for the B&aring;r&aring;
race from the Man&aacute;s river westwards to the neighbourhood of
Jalpaiguri. They would seem to be especially numerous in Goalpara
district, where one of the principal landholders is known as the
&ldquo;Mech-p&aacute;r&aacute; zamind&aacute;r.&rdquo; Some sixteen
exogamous septs are recognised among the Meches, of which the most
important would seem to be the following:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Mesh&aacute;-&aacute;r&#335;i&mdash;the tiger folk</li>
<li>2. B&aacute;nsb&aacute;r-&aacute;r&#335;i&mdash;bamboo folk</li>
<li>3. D&#335;im-&aacute;r&#335;i&mdash;water folk</li>
<li>4. Goib&aacute;r-&aacute;r&#335;i&mdash;betelnut folk</li>
<li>5. Swarg-&aacute;r&#335;i&mdash;heaven folk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these the last-mentioned, which is obviously of Hindu origin, is
looked upon as the highest, whilst the names of the remaining four are
apparently of totemistic origin. The first on the list,
<i>Mash&aacute;-ar&#335;i</i> (tiger folk; <i>Mash&aacute;</i>, tiger),
still retains a certain hold on the regard of the members of its sept,
all of whom go into a kind of mourning (see above) when a tiger is
found lying dead near one of their villages.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin.</span> Nothing definite is known as
to the origin of the Meches; by some they are said to be descended from
Bhim and Hidamba, whilst others maintain that they are the descendants
of Turbasu, son of Raja Jaj&aacute;ti, who fell under his
father&rsquo;s curse, his children thus becoming outcasts
(<i>Mlecchas</i>).</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion.</span> Their religion is
distinctly of the Animistic type with a tendency towards Hinduism,
Bath&aacute;u being replaced by &#346;iva in some cases. The
<i>siju</i> tree is regarded with much reverence, and is to be seen in
the courtyard of most Mech houses, much more frequently than among the
Kach&aacute;ris of this district. This sacred tree is sometimes used as
a means of divination or detecting crime or other misdoings in domestic
life.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Marriage and funeral ceremonies.</span></p>
<p>In all ceremonies relating to marriage and funerals, what has been
already said of the Kach&aacute;ris holds good almost word for word of
the Meches. But speaking generally it may be said that the marriage
rites among the Meches are more simple than among the Kach&aacute;ris,
the essential features being the exchange of betel-leaves and
areca-nuts between bride and bridegroom followed by the offering of a
cock and hen in sacrifice to Bath&aacute;u or &#346;iva. The funeral
ceremonies, on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>other hand, among the Meches are perhaps
somewhat more elaborate than is the case with the Kach&aacute;ris
(B&aring;r&aring;), as an informal Shr&aacute;dh has to be performed by
them, by the son or daughter of the deceased Mech, seven or nine or
eleven days after death, and sometimes on the day of the funeral
itself, an indication that Hindu customs are creeping in among this
portion of the B&aring;r&aring; race.</p>

<p><span class="marginnote">3. R&aacute;bh&aacute;s (70,000).</span>
The name of this tribe (R&aacute;bh&aacute;s) is of uncertain
derivation and in this district (Darrang) the people themselves are
sometimes called Totl&aacute;s, which may perhaps be a nickname.
Another term used in designating them is <i>D&#259;tiy&aacute;l
Kach&aacute;ri</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Borderer Kach&aacute;ris
(<i>d&aacute;ti</i>&mdash;border, edge, boundary); and it is held by
some that their original home and <span class=
"marginnote">Habitat.</span>habitat was the region <i>bordering</i> on
the northern slopes of the Garo Hills. This supposition is partly
confirmed by the fact that the only words in their language to express
(1) north and (2) south, respectively, are (1) <i>Bhot&aacute;
hi-chu</i>, Bhotan Hills,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4207src" href=
"#xd26e4207" name="xd26e4207src">2</a> and (2) <i>Tura</i>; their
physical horizon being apparently absolutely limited by the two
localities thus designated; moreover, R&aacute;bh&aacute;s in somewhat
large numbers are still to be found at the base of the northern slope
of the Garo Hills. Some 30,000 have their home in Goalpara district,
whilst others are located in Kamrup, north-west Darrang, and among the
Garos in their hills. <span class="marginnote">Origin
(traditional).</span>Their origin is but imperfectly known, but they
are said to be descended from a Hindu father who lost caste by marrying
a Kach&aacute;ri woman. Their <span class=
"marginnote">Language.</span>language, which would seem to be rapidly
dying out, forms a very interesting link between Garo and
Kach&aacute;ri, having much in common with both, but with some special
features peculiar to itself. Like the tongue of other branches of the
B&aring;r&aring; race, the R&aacute;bh&aacute; language, at one time
undoubtedly agglutinative, seems to be in process of becoming
inflexional, through contact and intercourse with the speakers of more
or less broken-down Sanskritic languages, <i>e.g.</i>, Bengali,
Assamese, etc. Some <span class="marginnote">Subdivisions.</span>seven
sub-tribes are said to be still recognised among the
R&aacute;bh&aacute;s, <i>i.e.</i>, Rangdaniya, Maitariy&aacute;,
P&aacute;ti-Koch, Bitliy&aacute;, D&aacute;huriy&aacute;, and
Sangh&aacute;. The members of the three sub-tribes first in this list
occupy a position of some eminence above the others, and are at liberty
to intermarry among themselves. They are, however, so far
&ldquo;hypergamous&rdquo; that if any one of their members should marry
into any of the last four sub-tribes, the person so marrying would have
to pay a fine of Rs. 100, or upwards, to the members of the lower
sub-tribe concerned. As regards <span class="marginnote">Social (caste)
status.</span>caste-position and status, the R&aacute;bh&aacute;s hold
themselves to be slightly higher than the pure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>Kach&aacute;ris, <i>e.g.</i>, the
R&aacute;bh&aacute; will not eat rice cooked by a Kach&aacute;ri,
though the latter freely partakes of food prepared by a
R&aacute;bh&aacute;. On the other hand, the R&aacute;bh&aacute; eats
and drinks quite as freely as does the Kach&aacute;ri, and
intermarriage between the two branches of the race is not very
uncommon, a young Kach&aacute;ri bridegroom selecting a
R&aacute;bh&aacute; bride having to make his peace with her people by
giving them a feast and paying a bride-price (<i>g&aacute;-dhan</i>) on
a somewhat enhanced scale. The children born of such a &ldquo;mixed
marriage&rdquo; belong to the father&rsquo;s tribe. Kach&aacute;ris
sometimes formally enter the R&aacute;bh&aacute; community, though it
is not necessary for them to do so, on their way to Hinduism. A
Kach&aacute;ri wishing to be received into the R&aacute;bh&aacute;
sub-tribe has to pass through a somewhat elaborate initiation, which
may be briefly summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Admission of a Kach&aacute;ri convert into
the R&aacute;bh&aacute; community.</span> &ldquo;A <i>deori</i>
(Priest) divides a pig into seven pieces in front of the
convert&rsquo;s door, and disposes of them by throwing away one such
piece towards each of the four cardinal points; while of the remaining
three pieces one is thrown skywards, a second earthwards, and the last
Pat&aacute;lwards.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4274src" href=
"#xd26e4274" name="xd26e4274src">3</a> At the same place he then
proceeds to cook a fowl and prepares therefrom a curry, which he
divides into seven equal parts; and arranging these portions on the
ground he leaves them there, after sprinkling them with
pad-jal.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4277src" href="#xd26e4277" name=
"xd26e4277src">4</a> This part of the ceremonial is known as
<i>ch&iacute;l&aacute;dhar</i>, or <i>b&aacute;odhar kat&aacute;</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, forms of making <i>pr&aacute;ya&#347;-chitta</i>
(reconciliation). The <i>deori</i> then lays down a plantain-leaf on
the courtyard and places on it a lighted lamp, a handful of rice, a
betel-leaf, and an areca-nut, together with some <i>tulasi</i> leaves
and a few copper coins. The convert is then made to drink
<i>pad-jal</i> in public, and after this he must pay at least one rupee
to the assembled people, and treat them to two vessels full of
rice-beer (<i>m&aring;dh</i>). He is further required to entertain
liberally the members of his newly-acquired brotherhood for three
successive evenings, pork and <i>m&aring;dh</i> forming the principal
materials of the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion.</span> Very little need be said
under the head of religion; for in this respect they are but little
separated from the closely-cognated Kach&aacute;ri (B&aring;r&aring;)
race. The general type of the R&aacute;bh&aacute; religion is
distinctly animistic; but one or two of the higher subdivisions,
especially the P&aacute;tis, are said to show a leaning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>towards
Hinduism of the &#346;&aacute;kta form, the deity chiefly worshipped
being known as Bhalli (? Bhareli), to whom <i>puja</i> is done in
K&#257;rtik, M&#257;gh and Bais&#257;kh. There are no temples or fixed
places of worship, nor are Brahmins employed; the <i>deori</i>
(<i>deosi</i>) doing all that is deemed necessary in public religious
ceremonies.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Relations of the sexes.</span> Marriage is
almost invariably adult, and is usually entered into by payment to the
bride&rsquo;s parents, or by servitude as among the Kach&aacute;ris.
Cases of ante-nuptial unchastity would seem to be rare; but when an
unmarried girl does become pregnant, she is compelled to disclose the
name of her lover, often through the <i>siju</i>-ordeal process (see
above), and public opinion forces the seducer to marry his victim,
paying a somewhat higher bride-price (<i>g&aacute;-dhan</i>) than he
would otherwise have done. Monogamy is the rule in marriage, but public
opinion permits the taking of a second wife when the first proves
childless. Divorce is permitted for adultery, but would seem to be
comparatively rare: widows are at liberty to marry whomsoever they
will, except the deceased husband&rsquo;s elder brother, a second
bride-price being sometimes paid to the bride&rsquo;s parents. The
marriage ceremony itself is very simple, the essential features being
(1) the exchange of betel-leaves and areca-nuts by bride and
bridegroom, and (2) the formal sacrifice of a cock and hen, the latter
being made into a curry of which bride and bridegroom partake together.
The dead are disposed of generally by cremation, though in cases of
destructive epidemics, <i>e.g.</i>, cholera,
k&aacute;l&aacute;-az&aacute;r, etc., known as &ldquo;<i lang=
"brx">sirk&aacute;ri rog</i>,&rdquo; the bodies of deceased people are
either hastily buried, or simply thrown into the neighbouring
jungle.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4367src" href="#xd26e4367" name=
"xd26e4367src">5</a></p>
<p><span class="marginnote">4. Hajongs&mdash;Haijongs. (8,000).</span>
About the small tribe (8,000 souls) known as Hajongs or Haijongs only
very little definite information can at present be obtained; but it
seems probable on the whole that they are a branch of the widely spread
B&aring;r&aring; race. The tribal name is of uncertain derivation, but
it is not unlikely that it is connected with the Kach&aacute;ri word
for mountain or hill (<i>ha-jo</i>); and this supposition receives,
perhaps, some little confirmation from their present known habitat,
<i>i.e.</i>, the southern slope of the Garo Hills, and the sub-montane
tract immediately adjoining it. It is possible that these people may be
the modern representatives of the inhabitants of the old kingdom of
Koch Hajo, which corresponds roughly with the present district of
Goalpara. It is known that during the period 1600&ndash;1700 this part
of the country was overrun by Musalm&aacute;n invaders, when many of
the inhabitants probably took refuge in the Garo Hills, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>returning therefrom, and settling in the adjoining
plains at the foot of these hills, when the <i lang="la">pax
Britannica</i> gave them a certain amount of security for life and
property. In appearance and dress the people are said to have a close
resemblance to the well-known Kach&aacute;ri type, but this resemblance
hardly holds good of their language as now spoken, for this is little
more than a medley of Assamese and Bengali.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion.</span> There are said to be two
recognised subdivisions among them, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) Byabch&aacute;ris
and (2) Param&aacute;rthis. The latter are largely Hinduized
(Vaishnabs) and abstain from pork and liquor, etc.; whilst the former,
who are &#346;&aacute;ktas to a large extent, follow the practice of
their Garo neighbours in matters of diet, etc. In spite, however, of
this distinction of meats, it is said that members of the two sections
of the tribe freely intermarry with each other. No Brahmins seem to be
employed among them, any leading member (<i>adhik&aacute;ri</i>) of the
village <i>panch&aacute;yat</i> doing what is customary at all
marriages, etc. It may be added that the siju tree (<i>euphorbia
splendens</i>) which occupies so important a place in the social and
religious life of the B&aring;r&aring;, Meches, etc., on the north of
the Brahmaputra does not seem to enjoy any special regard or respect
among the cognate tribes (Haijangs, Dim&aacute;s&aacute;<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4404" title="Not in source">,</span> etc.) who have
their homes on the south and east of that great river.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Relations of the sexes, marriage,
&amp;c.</span> As among other members of the B&aring;r&aring; race, the
relations of the sexes are on the whole sound and wholesome;
ante-nuptial unchastity is but of rare occurrence, but when it does
take place and pregnancy follows, the seducer is compelled to marry the
girl, and to pay a certain fine of no great amount to the village
elders. This form of union is known as a
<i>d&aacute;i-m&aacute;r&aacute;</i> marriage. But generally, as among
the Kach&aacute;ris of Darrang, the parents of bride and bridegroom
arrange for the marriage of the young people, which always includes the
payment of a bride-price (<i>p&aring;n</i>) of from 20 to 100 rupees to
the bride&rsquo;s parents, or the equivalent in personal service. It is
said that among the &ldquo;Param&aacute;rthi&rdquo; subdivision, who
are largely Hinduized, the betrothal of children is coming into vogue,
but as a rule marriage is still adult, and for the most part
monogamous. A second wife is allowed when the first proves to be
childless, but polyandry is quite unknown. Divorce is permitted for
adultery but is very rare, and under no circumstances can a woman be
divorced when in a state of pregnancy. The divorce itself is effected
in the usual way by the husband and wife tearing a betel-leaf in the
presence of the village elders, and formally addressing each other as
father and mother, showing that the relation of husband and wife has
ceased. Widows can marry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href=
"#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>again, and do so freely, the one
restriction being that no widow can marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s
brother, whether older or younger than her first partner. Here again,
too, it would seem that Hindu influence is making itself felt, for it
is said that the remarriage of widows is looked upon with growing
disfavour. Property, both movable and immovable, is usually divided
equally among the sons of a family (<i>cf.</i> the old Saxon law of
&ldquo;gavelkind&rdquo;), anything like primogeniture being unknown. In
a formal marriage among well-to-do people a certain ceremonial is
observed. A square enclosure is formed by planting a plantain-tree at
each corner, and within this enclosure are placed sixteen lighted
lamps, and sixteen earthenware pots full of water, the bridegroom
taking his stand in their midst. The bride then formally walks around
him seven times, and then finally takes a seat at his left side, her
face being turned towards the east. No <i>mantras</i>, etc., are
recited, nor is any Brahmin present; but some village elder
(<i>adhik&aacute;ri</i>) sprinkles water over the couple from one of
the water pots, and the ceremony is held to be complete.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disposal of dead.</span> The bodies of the
dead are occasionally buried or committed to the jungle, but this is
done but rarely, probably only under the pressure of panic during an
epidemic of cholera, etc. Cremation is almost universal, the head of
the deceased being placed towards the north, the face looking upwards
in the case of a man, and downwards in that of a woman. A
Sr&aacute;ddha usually follows either on the tenth, or the thirtieth,
day after the cremation.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">5. Mor&aacute;ns (5,800); Animistic, 100;
Hinduized, 5,700.</span> Not much is definitely known about this small
tribe, whose numbers do not exceed 6,000 in all; but although they are
said to repudiate all connection with the B&aring;r&aring; race, it may
be safely inferred that they do in reality belong to it; for on this
point the evidence of language is fairly conclusive.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4437src" href="#xd26e4437" name="xd26e4437src">6</a> They are
sometimes known as <span class="marginnote">Names.</span>(1)
Mor&aacute;n Kach&aacute;ris and (2) Kap&aacute;hiy&aacute;s
(<i>kap&aacute;h</i>&mdash;cotton), the latter name being due to the
fact that in early days one of their chief duties was to grow cotton
for the use of &Aacute;hom princesses, at K&aacute;katal,
Mori&aacute;ni, Jh&aacute;nzi, Holog&aacute;p&aacute;r, etc. Their
present <span class="marginnote">Habitat.</span>habitat may be roughly
described as the country lying between the Buri Dihing and the
Brahmaputra in the north-eastern part of the Province at least one-half
of their number being located in the district of Lakhimpur, and the
remainder in the adjoining portions of the Sibsagar district. Their
chief centre is said to be a place known as K&aacute;katal, the
residence of the Tiphuk Gosain, the head of the Matak clan,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>with the members of which the Mor&aacute;ns are
said to fraternize and even to intermarry freely.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Origin (traditional).</span> The original
home of the Mor&aacute;ns is said to have been at Mongkong
(Maingkhwang) in the Hukong Valley at the upper reaches of the Chindwin
river, where some centuries ago resided three brothers Moylang,
Mor&aacute;n, and Moyr&aacute;n. Of these, Moylang, the eldest,
remained in the Hukong Valley, whilst the youngest, Moyr&aacute;n,
migrated into Nip&aacute;l, and was there lost sight of; and
Mor&aacute;n, the second brother, passed the Patkoi range into Assam
and, settling on the Tiphuk river, became the ancestor of or at least
gave its present name to the Mor&aacute;n tribe. But however this may
be, it is fairly certain that, when the &Aacute;homs passed into Assam
about the middle of the thirteenth century, they at once came into
conflict with the Mor&aacute;ns, whom they seem to have subdued with
but little difficulty. By their &Aacute;hom conquerors the
Mor&aacute;ns were employed in various menial capacities, as hewers of
wood and drawers of water, and were sometimes known as
H&aacute;bungiy&aacute;s,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4458src" href=
"#xd26e4458" name="xd26e4458src">7</a> earth-folk, or true
autochthones, &ldquo;sons of the soil,&rdquo; though they seem to have
intermarried freely with their &Aacute;hom rulers. But in spite of
their subordinate position in political life the Mor&aacute;ns, like
other branches of the B&aring;r&aring; race, have sturdily maintained
some of their national characteristics to this day, <i>e.g.</i>, their
language, though apparently doomed to early extinction, is still to
some extent retained by members of the clan.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion.</span> In the census of 1891 only
100 Mor&aacute;ns are returned as animistic, the great bulk of them
being described as Hindus of the <span class=
"marginnote">Vaishnab.</span>Vaishnab type. Their Hinduism, however,
would seem to be of a somewhat lax character; for though they do not
eat beef, pork, or monkeys, or drink madh and photik&aacute;, yet they
freely partake of all kinds of poultry and fish, with the tortoise,
grasshopper, etc. No social stigma, too, attaches to the catching and
selling of fish to others. No idols are to be seen in their villages,
nor are Brahmins ever employed in religious ceremonials, certain
officials known as Medhis and Bhakats doing all that is deemed
necessary on these occasions. On certain great social gatherings known
as Sabh&aacute; (Sam&aacute;j), which are apparently not held at any
fixed periods, there is much singing, beating of drums (Mridang) and
cymbals (t&aacute;l) in honour of Krishna, to whom offerings of rice,
salt, plantains, betel-nuts, are freely made. In earlier times it is
said that there were three chief centres (satras) of the religious life
of the Mor&aacute;ns; each <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>presided over by an elder known as
the bur&aacute; or d&aacute;ngariy&aacute;. These were the (1) Dinja
(<span class="corr" id="xd26e4491" title=
"Source: Kachari">Kach&aacute;ri</span> bur&aacute;), (2)
Garpar&aacute; (&Aacute;hom bur&aacute;), and (3) Puranim&aacute;ti
(Kh&aacute;tw&aacute;l bur&aacute;). These d&aacute;ngariy&aacute;s are
said still to retain a position of some spiritual influence among the
Mor&aacute;ns, all religious teaching being in their hands. Each family
may freely choose its own d&aacute;ngariy&aacute;s, but followers of
one d&aacute;ngariy&aacute; will not eat food cooked by those of
another, even when the worshippers are closely connected with each
other by family ties, as father, son, brother, etc.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Marriages, etc.</span> Infant betrothals
would seem to be absolutely unknown, all marriages being restricted to
adults, as a rule monogamous, though a second wife may be taken when
the first proves childless. Occasionally the bridegroom carries off his
bride by force, especially during the April Bihu, the union formed in
this way being afterwards recognised by the girl&rsquo;s parents.
Sometimes the bride goes to her lover&rsquo;s house of her own free
will, without payment of the usual bride-price (p&aring;n). But as a
rule as among other portions of the B&aring;r&aring; race, matrimonial
engagements are entered into after negotiations between the parents of
the persons concerned. The essential elements of a marriage in this
case are (1) the payment of a bride-price (p&aring;n) of some Rs
20&ndash;100 to the girl&rsquo;s parents, and (2) the giving of a feast
at the bridegroom&rsquo;s expense to the parents, relatives, and
friends of the bride. The marriage ceremony is always
non-Sh&aacute;stric, nor are Brahmins present, a Bhakat or
d&aacute;ngariy&aacute; doing all that is deemed necessary. The
ceremony itself may perhaps be described as
&ldquo;semi-chacklang,&rdquo; some, though not all, of the rites
practised among the &Aacute;homs at what is called a <i>chaklang</i>
marriage being frequently carried out.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Divorce.</span> Divorce is permitted
occasionally, but only when the wife is guilty of adultery with a man
of lower caste-standing than her own. In these cases the husband brings
back the erring wife to her father&rsquo;s house with some betel-nuts
and one rupee in an earthenware <i>sar&aacute;i</i>; the father
receives her and gives back a portion of the betel-nuts to the husband,
and the woman is at once free to marry again. Widows are at liberty to
remarry, but not with the deceased husband&rsquo;s brother; but little
or <span class="corr" id="xd26e4509" title="Source: on">no</span>
ceremonial is observed at such a remarriage, a widow taking a
substantially lower position than a virgin bride.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disposal of dead.</span> The dead are
usually disposed of by burial, but the bodies of old Bhakats are
sometimes cremated, the ashes being afterwards buried under a high
earth mound known as a &ldquo;moid&aacute;m.&rdquo; On the third day
after death takes place the ceremony known as <i>telani</i>, when the
near relatives are anointed with mustard seed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>oil
(tel). This is followed ten days later by the
<i>dah&aacute;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4524src" href=
"#xd26e4524" name="xd26e4524src">8</a> when offerings of rice, salt,
betel-nuts, etc., are offered by the relatives, and finally, after an
interval of twenty days, the <i>dah&aacute; k&aacute;j</i> is
celebrated, when a general feast takes place both day and night. These
observances have perhaps more in common with funeral wakes than with
what is known among Hindus as a shr&aacute;ddha; no Brahmins are
present.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">6. Chutiyas (87,691).<br>
Deori Chutiyas, 4,000.<br>
Habitat.</span> This once very powerful race, which still numbers
almost 90,000 souls, has its chief home and habitat in the districts of
Lakhimpur and Sibsagar, though a not inconsiderable number are found in
the Darrang district (Mangaldai subdivision). Their general appearance
and physical and mental characteristics prove clearly that they belong
to the widely spread B&aring;r&aring; race, and this view is borne out
by the language still spoken to some extent by one of the subdivisions
of the race (the Deoris), which has very much in common with the
Kach&aacute;ri of Darrang, and still more with the speech of the people
(Dim&aacute;s&aacute;) of the north Kachar Hills.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Traditional origin and history.</span>
Their origin is far from being clearly known. According to one
tradition&mdash;probably the outcome of Hindu
imaginativeness&mdash;they claim to be descendants of Khetrias who fled
into Assam for refuge from the destroying arm of Para&#347;u-Ram
(battle-axe Ram). But according to a tradition embodied in an old
Assamese chronicle of uncertain date, the founder of the Chutiya
kingdom, for some 200 years a very powerful one, was one Bihar (?
Virap&aacute;la), who is said to have had his home on &ldquo;Golden
Hill&rdquo; (Suvar&#7751;a-giri) in the mountains to the north of the
modern Sadiya, which place was for a lengthened period the centre of
Chutiya power, before the advent of the &Aacute;homs in the 15th
century. It is said that Kuvera (the Hindu Pluto) appeared to this
Bihar, who was simply an ordinary peasant, and urged him to be
reconciled to his wife (Rupavati), with whom he had quarrelled, as she
was about to present him with a son who should make a name in history.
Moreover, he was directed to make search under a certain tree where he
would find a shield, a sword, and a spear; and underneath the shield a
golden cat, which latter he was to preserve with the utmost care, as it
was to be the talisman of his family&rsquo;s fortunes. Kuvera&rsquo;s
instructions were duly carried out by Bihar, to whom a son was born,
named Ratnadhwaj, who through force of character established his
influence in the mountains; and then descending to the plains
established a powerful kingdom at Sadiya which maintained itself there
for over two centuries, when it fell before the rapidly growing
influence of the warlike &Aacute;homs. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>order finally to break up
the power of the Chutiyas their &Aacute;hom conquerors are said to have
distributed the subjugated race over Assam and north-east Bengal. One
not inconsiderable portion of the Mangaldai subdivision is still known
as Chutiya de&#347;; otherwise Kaup&aacute;ti. To this Machiavellian
policy of the &Aacute;hom rulers is perhaps due the present widely
scattered condition of the once powerful Kach&aacute;ri race.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Subdivisions (modern).</span></p>
<p>There are four subdivisions of the Chutiya race still recognised,
viz.:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Hindu Chutiya.</li>
<li>2. &Aacute;hom Chutiya.</li>
<li>3. Deori Chutiya&mdash;the Levite or priestly clan.</li>
<li>4. Bar&aacute;hi Chutiya&mdash;the pig-eating clan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these subdivisions is said to have been in early days
endogamous, though this is hardly so now, for members of the two upper
clans can intermarry, and the same statement holds good of the two
lower (Deori and Bar&aacute;hi); but outside these limits marriage is
said to be prohibited. The Hindu and &Aacute;hom Chutiyas have very
largely adopted Hinduism of the Vaishnava type; but it is said that
occasionally they indulge in secluded midnight revels known as
&ldquo;r&aacute;ti so&aacute; kho&aacute;,&rdquo; at which almost all
kinds of food (beef alone excepted) are very freely consumed. The
Deoris and Bar&aacute;his, however, still follow largely certain
animistic rites; so far as they have adopted Hinduism at all, it would
seem to be of a depraved type, Tantric rather than Vedic.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Deoris.</span> By far the most
interesting, because the most primitive, characteristic of the four
subdivisions of the Chutiya race mentioned above, is that which holds
the third place in the list; <i>i.e.</i>, the Deoris. It has been
stated before more than once that this term Deoris is thus used to
designate the recognised ministers of religion throughout the
B&aring;r&aring; race; and this points to the fact that they are
essentially what indeed their tribal name implies, a Levite or priestly
body, and one in earlier days possessed of large influence which even
yet has not been wholly lost. In point of mere numbers they are
certainly not a powerful body, somewhat less than 4,000 all told. Their
chief habitat is on and near the Dikrang river some thirty miles west
of the subdivisional station of North Lakhimpur, while other villages
may be found in the M&aacute;juli, the &ldquo;Holy Land&rdquo; of the
modern (Hindu) Assamese, where they would seem to lead a very simple
primitive life. A Deori Chutiya village has been well described as
follows<span class="corr" id="xd26e4574" title="Source: .">:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It consists of some thirty houses built on bamboo platforms
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>raised about five feet from the ground. A single
house will often contain a family of forty persons, living in one great
room without any compartments, though with separate fireplaces, with a
verandah in front where visitors are entertained. The villagers are a
tall, large, well-nourished folk, with features bearing a strong
resemblance to that of the Kach&aacute;ris. They drink strong liquor
(home-made) and eat all kinds of flesh except beef.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Language.</span> There are two things which
give a certain interest and importance to the Deoris in spite of the
paucity of their numbers, <i>i.e.</i>, (1) their language and (2) their
religion<span class="corr" id="xd26e4588" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Like other members of the widely spread
B&aring;r&aring; race, the Deoris are bilingual, speaking both Assamese
and their own tongue, but giving a distinct preference to the latter,
of which they are said to be not a little proud.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4591src" href="#xd26e4591" name="xd26e4591src">9</a> The language
itself is obviously very closely allied to that of the Kach&aacute;ris
of Darrang and still more so to the speech of the people of the North
Kach&aacute;r Hills (Dim&aacute;s&aacute;), who, being more isolated
from the plains than are the Kach&aacute;ris, have no doubt preserved
their mother tongue very largely in its primitive form. In all
likelihood the language of the Deori Chutiy&aacute;s gives us the
purest and most archaic form of the B&aring;r&aring; speech, and there
can be little doubt that in earlier times it was the dominant language
of Eastern Assam.</p>
<p>The religion of the Deori Chutiy&aacute;s is still largely
animistic. There are a number of domestic gods, who hold a prominent
place in family worship, and puja is often performed under big trees
and by the side of rivers, as among the Darrang Kach&aacute;ris. The
Brahmaputra is held in special reverence and is spoken of as the mother
of water (ji chim&aacute;, or chim&aacute; jim&aacute;) much as the
Darrang Kach&aacute;ris regard this huge volume of water as
&ldquo;Mater magna&rdquo; (Hodgson).</p>
<p>Unlike the western Kach&aacute;ris, however, the Deori
Chutiy&aacute;s pay no special regard to the &lsquo;siju&rsquo; tree
(<i>Euphorbia splendens</i>), a peculiarity which they share with the
Dim&aacute;s&aacute;, L&aacute;lungs, G&aacute;ros,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4605src" href="#xd26e4605" name="xd26e4605src">10</a> and
other members of the B&aring;r&aring; family who have their home mostly
on the south of the great river. They have four great annual festivals,
two of which correspond in some respects to the Assamese M&aacute;gh
and Bais&aacute;k Bihu, though not held exactly on the same dates. They
have a great reputation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>as wizards, etc., and are supposed to
have the power of causing their enemies to die mysteriously of slow
occult wasting diseases, and in this way they are often consulted by
their neighbours in cases of loss of cattle or undetected robberies.
There would seem to be three principal gods:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Girasi-gir&aacute; (Bur&aacute;-buri), <i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the
old ones,&rdquo; always spoken of as a wedded pair (<i>cf.</i> the
&ldquo;Bathau and the Mainau&rdquo; of the Darrang Kach&aacute;ris and
the &ldquo;Warang-Berang,&rdquo; &lsquo;the old one&rsquo; of
Hodgson&rsquo;s Dhimals); they are specially worshipped by the
Dibongi&aacute; khel, and their original temple was on the Kundil
river, a little east of Sadiya.</p>
<p>(2) Pisha-dema (Bohza-hemata), &ldquo;the elder son&rdquo;
worshipped by the Teng&aacute; p&aacute;niya khel. His temple stood on
Teng&aacute;p&aacute;ni river.</p>
<p>(3) Pisha-si, &ldquo;the daughter,&rdquo; known as (1)
T&aacute;meshwari m&aacute;i, the &ldquo;mother of the copper
temple,&rdquo; and (2) Kech&aacute;-kh&aacute;ti, the &ldquo;raw-flesh
eater,&rdquo; to whom human sacrifices were offered. She was worshipped
by the Bargaya (Borgoniya) khel and her temple stood somewhere near
&ldquo;Chunpura&rdquo; (&lsquo;lime-kiln&rsquo;) on the Brahmaputra a
few miles east of Sadiya.</p>
<p>In addition to these a fourth khel, P&aacute;torgiya, is said to
have once existed, but its status was inferior to those of the other
three, and it has consequently become extinct. To each of these khels
and temples four priests (puj&aacute;ris) were attached, <i>i.e.</i>,
(1) a Bor Deori (Deori Dima) and (2) a Saru Deori (Deori Sarba); and
(3) a Bor Bhar&aacute;li, and (4) a Saru Bhar&aacute;li.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4636src" href="#xd26e4636" name=
"xd26e4636src">11</a> It is the former two (the Deoris), who alone
perform the sacrifice, enter the temple and sing hymns, etc., which are
hardly now understood by the laity. The office of the Bhar&aacute;lis
was an inferior one; it was their duty to collect all temple-offerings
and to provide animals for sacrifice. They are also privileged to hold
the head of the victim, which is nowadays usually a goat. As a rule no
images, etc., are to be seen in the temples, though such images would
seem to be provided from time to time as needed for purposes of public
worship.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Human sacrifices (Narabali).</span> Of the
Deori temples mentioned above the oldest and most noteworthy is
undoubtedly that known as the &ldquo;T&aacute;mar ghar&rdquo; or copper
temple, at Chunpura, the ruins of which are, it is said, still to be
seen some miles east of Sadiya. It is described as a small stone
building nearly square, built without cement, the stones joined by iron
pins, not clamped. The roof, now fallen in, was of copper; hence the
temple&rsquo;s name. The interior is eight feet square; and the whole
is enclosed by a brick wall 130 feet by 200. Near the grand entrance in
the western wall is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"
name="pb94">94</a>]</span>small stone tripod. Here from a period
unknown down to a comparatively recent date human sacrifices were
offered year by year. It is said that latterly the &Aacute;hom kings
gave up for this purpose malefactors who had been sentenced to capital
punishment; but as suitable victims of this type were not always
forthcoming, a certain special tribe (khel) of the king&rsquo;s
subjects were held bound to provide one and in return the members of
this tribe were entitled to certain privileges, <i>e.g.</i>, exemption
from payment of ferry dues and market tolls, etc. It was necessary in
all cases that the victims should be of high caste and &ldquo;without
blemish,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4653src" href="#xd26e4653"
name="xd26e4653src">12</a> the slightest mutilation, even the boring of
an ear, rendering them unfit to be offered.</p>
<p>All Brahmins and members of the royal family were exempted as a
privilege; whilst Domes, Haris, Musalm&aacute;ns and women were
excluded as unfit. For some time preceding the sacrifice the victim to
be immolated was detained at the temple and sumptuously fed there,
until he attained a sufficiently plump condition to suit the assumed
taste of the flesh-eating goddess. On the appointed day he was led
forth, magnificently attired and decorated with gold and silver
ornaments, to be shown to the crowds assembled for the occasion. He was
then led away and taken, by a private path trodden only by the
officiating priests and their victims, to the brink of a deep pit,
where he was divested of his gay attire and decapitated so that the
body fell into the pit. The head was added to a heap of ghastly skulls
that were piled up before the shrine. The exact date when these fearful
sacrifices ceased does not seem to be definitely known. Lieutenant
(afterwards Colonel) Dalton, from whose highly interesting paper most
of the above details are taken, states that they were in vogue down to
the time when the &Aacute;hom Government was superseded by that of the
Burmese, when the Deoris finally withdrew from the neighbourhood of the
&ldquo;copper temple.&rdquo; Mr. Brown, on the other hand, tells us
that these human sacrifices were abolished at a somewhat earlier date
by Raja Gaurinath, who, also being unable to protect the Deoris from
the Mishmis and other tribes, removed them to the Majuli,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4662src" href="#xd26e4662" name=
"xd26e4662src">13</a> where some of their villages are still to be
found.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Marriage, etc.</span> As among other
branches of the B&aring;r&aring; race, infant betrothal is unknown, no
marriage being permitted until puberty is attained. Monogamy is the
rule among Deoris and Bar&aacute;his; but a second wife is allowed
where the first proves childless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>Polygamy is common among Hindu
and &Aacute;hom Chutiyas, but polyandry is quite unknown. Marriages are
generally planned and arranged by the parents of the young people
concerned, a bride-price varying from Rs. 10 to Rs. 100 being paid to
the bride&rsquo;s parents by those of the bridegroom, or an equivalent
given in service in the bride&rsquo;s household (<i>cf.</i> Genesis,
xxix. 15&ndash;20: Jacob serving Laban seven years for Rachel).</p>
<p>The actual marriage ceremony seems to vary considerably in the four
different clans (khels) which compose the Chutiya community. With the
two lower sections, <i>i.e.</i>, the Deoris and Bar&aacute;his, it
consists in a feast given by the bridegroom&rsquo;s people to the
friends and fellow-villagers of the bride, accompanied by much singing
of songs, etc., in honour of the clan gods and goddesses, whilst with
not a few even this simple ceremonial is dispensed with, and the young
man claims his bride by merely placing bracelets on her wrists and a
string of beads, etc., on her neck (Kh&aacute;ru and mani
pindho&aacute;).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4679src" href="#xd26e4679"
name="xd26e4679src">14</a> But among the &Aacute;hom and Deori
Chutiyas, who claim a somewhat higher position than the other two
sections, a more elaborate ceremonial is observed. The &Aacute;hom
Chutiyas to some extent still observe the form of marriage
characteristic of their race, <i>i.e.</i>, that known as the Chaklang.
There is an exchange of <i>temi</i> and <i>kat&aacute;ri</i> between
bride and bridegroom, who are made formally to inhale the smell of
turmeric together, and this is followed by the tying of the nuptial
knot (lagun g&aacute;thi), and the distribution of simple refreshments
(jal-p&aacute;n) among the assembled friends and relatives; and finally
the bridegroom is said to carry off his bride through a hole cut in the
corner of the house, this last proceeding being perhaps a survival of
the time when marriage by capture or stealth was not unknown. With the
Hindu Chutiyas there is a still more elaborate ceremonial in vogue, one
which approximates somewhat closely to the orthodox Hindu ideal. The
<i>chaklang</i> form is superseded by that of the &lsquo;hom,&rsquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, libations of clarified butter (ghi) are formally poured in
sacrifice on the sacred fire, and certain special mantras are recited
by the officiating priest in the presence of the bride and bridegroom,
who are formally seated by his side, and formally united by the tying
of the nuptial knot (lagun-g&aacute;thi). It is said, further, that
matrimonial etiquette requires postponement of consummation of the
marriage for a week or so after the completion of the wedding
ceremonial.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Divorce, widow, remarriage, etc.</span>
Divorce, which would seem to be not very common, may and usually does
follow adultery on the part of the wife, the adulterer paying a fine of
Rs. 500 to the injured husband, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>further being compelled to
provide a home for the erring woman, whom no respectable man of the
tribe would consent to marry. The form used in cases of divorce is the
usual one of tearing a betel-leaf (p&aacute;n-chir&aacute;) together by
the husband and the wife. The remarriage of widows is permitted with
few, if any, restrictions; but as a rule the full marriage ceremonial,
whether &lsquo;hom&rsquo; or &lsquo;chaklang,&rsquo; is not observed in
such widow remarriages.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Disposal of the dead.</span> The bodies of
the dead are usually disposed of by burning, except in cases of
epidemics, when, through panic or like cause, they are thrown into the
jungle, or left to perish where they fall. The cremation is generally
followed by a funeral feast, lasting for a period of from five to nine
days, either at the deceased&rsquo;s house or at the river-side where
the body was burnt. A shr&aacute;dh with feasting of the dead
man&rsquo;s relatives takes place usually at the end of a month after
the cremation. This shr&aacute;dh marks the closing of the period of
mourning, which in the case of an adult extends over about thirty days,
during which period no flesh or fish may be eaten, though rice, ghi and
potatoes are allowed. In the case of those who die in childhood no
shr&aacute;dh is observed, though the bereaved family usually go into
mourning for some three days.</p>

<p class="first">To the stories taken by Mr. Endle from my little
collection of Kach&aacute;ri folk-tales, I have ventured to add the
following three tales, with an interlinear literal translation and some
brief linguistic notes. This I have done in order to follow the example
set in Sir C. J. Lyall&rsquo;s edition of Mr. Edward Stack&rsquo;s work
on the <a class="pglink xd26e52" title=
"Link to Project Gutenberg ebook" href=
"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48706">Mikirs</a>. A transcription
followed by a loose translation is not of much use to linguistic
students unless they have already some knowledge of the language. I
ought to explain that I have not followed Mr. Endle&rsquo;s system of
transliteration. In a language which has no written character, it is
best to trust to one&rsquo;s own ear. In such languages dialect springs
up quickly and local differences of pronunciation abound. I have merely
tried, therefore, to record what I have myself heard. With the aid of
the literal versions I now give, and by carefully reading Mr.
Endle&rsquo;s Grammar, anyone who wishes to compare Kach&aacute;ri with
other Bodo languages, such as Garo and Tippera, ought to be able to
make out the remainder of the stories in my little collection without
much difficulty.</p>
<p>The vowels are recorded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sound represented by &#365; is rather difficult to describe to
Europeans. To my ear, it seems rather guttural, something like the u in
&ldquo;ugh!&rdquo; or the vulgar pronunciation of girl as
&ldquo;gurl.&rdquo; Or, again, it may be said to be like the French
<i>eu</i> in <i>peu</i>, as pronounced by English people. Or perhaps a
still nearer approximation is the Englishman&rsquo;s &ldquo;er&rdquo;
when he pauses in making an after-dinner speech. The sound is of some
importance, as -&#365;i is the suffix by which the adverb in modern
Kach&aacute;ri is formed from the adjective. Thus ga-h&#257;m, good;
gah&#257;m-&#365;i, well. Also the continuative participle, as,
th&#257;ng-&#365;i, th&#257;ng-&#365;i; going, going&mdash;as he
went.</p>
<p>When &#257; is added to a noun, it is, as in Assamese, the sign of
the nominative. If the word ends in a vowel, and especially in the
vowel &#257;, an euphonic i is inserted between the two vowels. Thus
hingzau-s&#257;, is &ldquo;woman.&rdquo; Hingzau-s&#257;-i-&#257; is
&ldquo;the woman,&rdquo; in a narrative. Similarly -au is the inflexion
marking the locative case. If the word ends in &#257;, this letter is
divided from au by an euphonic i.</p>
<p>Words borrowed from Assamese or other Indian languages are printed
in Roman letters. Some such may have escaped me. If so, they have
probably been so transmuted by Bodo habits of pronunciation as to have
become completely naturalised.</p>
<p>&#256; inserted or &ldquo;infixed&rdquo; in the middle of a verb
(between stem and inflexion) is the sign of the negative. Sometimes the
euphonic i precedes it. Sometimes, especially before a guttural sound,
it is converted into e.</p>
<p>No other supplementary explanations beyond those given in Mr.
Endle&rsquo;s note on grammar seem required here.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The story of the simpleton.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once an old man and an old woman, and they
had an only son. One day he begged rupees of the old people to buy a
bullock, but they, seeing the lad was an innocent, refused his request.
However, on his importuning them, they gave him sixteen rupees. On
which he marched off to purchase his bullock, and finding a fine one
where three roads met, he put down his money on the road and led the
beast away, but as he was going, he tied his new acquisition to a
branch, and, as he was looking another way, it escaped. On which he
started in search of it, and seeing a stag, hunted that, until by
chance its horns stuck in a thicket. Thereon he tied a cord round its
neck, and joining other cords to the first, finally reached his home.
On which his father and mother asked, &ldquo;Did not you set out to buy
a bullock?&rdquo; &ldquo;To be sure I did,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;and if you help me to pull this cord, you will see the bullock I
have bought.&rdquo; So they all three tugged, and presently the stag
appeared, kicking and struggling, to the great fear of the old people.
They killed it, nevertheless, and sent its flesh round to the adjacent
villages for sale. After which the boy went about saying that the
villagers had eaten cow&rsquo;s flesh. But seeing him to be a fool, no
one paid much attention to what he said.</p>
<p>Another day, some time after, when the silly boy was rather bigger,
he asked for money again to buy a wife with. And again, overcome by his
obstinacy, they gave him sixteen rupees, taking which he set out in
search of a maiden, and, after going some distance, took up his station
at a place where the villagers draw water from the river. Presently a
pretty girl came tripping down to get water, on which, as before, he
put down his money and seized and carried off the girl. And since she
was plump, he soon grew tired and rested under a tree. Presently a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>man leading a plough ox came that way, and he
too joined the party and sat down. But the girl sat weeping and
lamenting and crying her eyes out. Seeing which, the man said to the
simpleton, &ldquo;Where did you get that girl? And did you have a good
look at her before you took her?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said
the lad, &ldquo;I saw that she was a pretty girl, so I put down sixteen
rupees at the village watering place and carried her off.&rdquo; On
which the cunning fellow said, &ldquo;You must be blind, my friend; she
may be a pretty girl, but both her eyes are burst. Did you not see
that? Why, look at them now. The water is running from them in streams.
What are you going to do with a girl like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing that, the lad wanted to exchange the girl for the plough
ox, and the man cunningly pretended to be unwilling, but was finally
persuaded by the simpleton&rsquo;s importunacy, and said, &ldquo;There,
take it, and begone.&rdquo; So the exchange was effected, and each
quickly went his own way, mightily pleased with his bargain.</p>
<p>After going some way, the boy met a man with a goat. This man too
sat down. After a while the ox eased itself, and the man with the goat
said, &ldquo;That beast&rsquo;s belly is burst, and in a day or two it
will die.&rdquo; The simpleton, believing every word he said, exchanged
his ox for the goat, and went his way. Presently he met a man carrying
a bunch of bananas, and sat down beside him. But the goat was hungry
for grass and kept wandering about and crying &ldquo;Ba! ba!&rdquo; so
that his master got no peace. Now the word &ldquo;b&#257;&rdquo; in
Kach&aacute;ri means &ldquo;Carry me on your back.&rdquo; So the boy
was vexed, and crying &ldquo;How shall I carry you on my back when I am
so tired?&rdquo; exchanged the goat for the bunch of bananas. And again
each went his way.</p>
<p>By chance there came a man that way snapping his fingers. And he
asked for the bananas. But the simpleton said, &ldquo;I got those
bananas in exchange for a goat, and you ask me for them! However, if
you really want to eat the fruit, teach me the art of snapping the
fingers, and you shall have them.&rdquo; After an hour&rsquo;s
teaching, he had learned the difficult art, more or less, and, giving
up the bananas, departed snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>Presently he came to a fine field of rice, and there forgot his new
art. Fancying he had lost it in the rice, he began searching for it in
the crop as women search for lice in one another&rsquo;s hair, and the
rice-field was all trodden down. And then the owner of the field came
up and asked, &ldquo;What are you looking for there?&rdquo; The
simpleton said, &ldquo;I have lost something for which I gave sixteen
rupees. If you will join me in my search, I shall be greatly
obliged.&rdquo; So the man searched <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>too, and the crop
suffered greatly. But finding nothing, the man, in pure vexation,
snapped his fingers. On which the lad, crying, &ldquo;<i>That</i> is
just what I lost!&rdquo; danced away gaily.</p>
<p>Soon after he paused on the bank of a pond, and again forgot his
art, and began wading about in the mud looking for it. And a man asked
him, as before, what he had lost. So he replied, &ldquo;Something for
which I gave sixteen rupees.&rdquo; And the man joined him in the
search, and both became covered with mud from head to foot. And, since
they found nothing, the man grew angry, and snapped his fingers. On
which the boy cried in joy, &ldquo;Good sir, <i>that</i> is what I
lost!&rdquo; and danced away to his home. And when his old parents saw
him covered with mud, they burst out laughing, and, until they heard
his voice, did not know who he was. And when they asked what he had
done with his money, he explained that he had bought a girl, whom he
had exchanged for an ox, which he gave in exchange for a goat, which
angered him by ordering him to carry it on his back, so that he
exchanged it for a bunch of bananas, which he gave in exchange for the
art of snapping his fingers. &ldquo;And what else did you expect me to
do?&rdquo; said the simpleton! And that&rsquo;s all!</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Monkey and the Hare.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A monkey and a hare were great friends. They ever
lived together, ate together, and went about together. One day meeting
a man from Darrang going to a feast with a load of bananas and other
delicacies, they said to one another, &ldquo;We must get what that man
is carrying by some trick or other.&rdquo; Whereupon the monkey bade
the hare stay on the road, while he himself hid in the forest.
Presently the man, seeing the hare, put down his load and ran after it.
On which the monkey, coming out from the jungle, carried off the
bananas and other things. And for fear the hare should come and ask his
share, the monkey hastily gobbled up the bananas and betel-nuts and
kept the skins only for his friend.</p>
<p>The man, not being able to catch the hare, went home, and then the
hare, shouting aloud, searched for the monkey, and, when he found him,
demanded his share of the spoil, and only got the skins. So, being
vexed, he determined to have his revenge. And first he went and hid
under some acrid <i>kachu</i> plants. And when the monkey came and
asked what he was doing, he replied, &ldquo;My friend, I have the
honour to be in charge of the king&rsquo;s sugar-canes.&rdquo; So the
monkey said, &ldquo;Ah, give me just a bit, do.&rdquo; But the hare
replied, &ldquo;And what do you suppose the king will say?&rdquo; But
the monkey was importunate. So the hare gave him a stalk of
<i>kachu</i> to chew, and when the acrid juice stung his tongue, the
monkey began dancing about howling. But the hare coolly said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your own fault! You <i>would</i> have a stick of
the king&rsquo;s sugar-cane, and what could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the hare went and took up his post under a hornet&rsquo;s nest,
and the monkey came along, shouting for his friend, and, finding him
asked, &ldquo;What may you be doing <i>there</i>?&rdquo; And the hare
replied, &ldquo;I am guarding the king&rsquo;s drum, so there!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the monkey, &ldquo;do let me beat the
king&rsquo;s drum!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, but I cannot,&rdquo; said the
hare, &ldquo;the king will be angry.&rdquo; But the monkey insisted,
and said, &ldquo;I will play on the drum <i>very</i> gently; you
see!&rdquo; So the hare consenting, the monkey clapped his two palms on
the hornet&rsquo;s nest and broke it, so that the hornets emerged, and
stung him sore, so that he screamed with pain. But the hare only said,
&ldquo;You would have your way, and what was I to do?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next the hare went and sat down near a <i>gowal</i> snake. And the
monkey came shouting, and asked, &ldquo;What are you about now, my
friend?&rdquo; The hare replied, &ldquo;I am now in charge of the
king&rsquo;s sceptre!&rdquo; On which the monkey said, &ldquo;Ah, let
me just wield the king&rsquo;s sceptre for a moment!&rdquo; But the
hare answered, &ldquo;I cannot do that, for the king will be
angry.&rdquo; But the monkey being importunate, he consented.
Whereupon, of course, the snake bit him, and he howled with pain.</p>
<p>Then the hare went and sat in a marshy place, and the monkey came
shouting in search of him, and asked what he was doing. And the hare
told him he was sitting on the king&rsquo;s litter. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;
prayed the monkey, &ldquo;let <i>me</i> too sit on the king&rsquo;s
litter.&rdquo; But the hare said angrily, &ldquo;And what do you
suppose the king will say? It strikes me you are a fool, my friend, and
listen to no warning!&rdquo; But the monkey, insisting, leaped into the
marsh, sank up to his neck, and stuck there miserably. On which the
hare leaped out and cried, &ldquo;Now, my kind friend, you who eat
bananas and give me the skins, you can just stay where you are! My
compliments! I am off!&rdquo; So saying, he left him to his fate.</p>
<p>Presently a rhinoceros came that way, and the monkey begged him to
extricate him. But the rhinoceros remarked that he was hungry and
thirsty and on his way home to dinner, and went his way. And a buffalo
also passed by and refused to help. Finally a tiger came, extremely
ravenous. And the monkey entreated him respectfully to pull him out;
but the tiger said he did not see how it would profit him to come to
his rescue. But when he had gone some two paces, the monkey called
after him, &ldquo;Look here, if you will drag me out of the marsh, you
can clean me of the mud, and eat me!&rdquo; And since the tiger was
extremely hungry, he consented and said, &ldquo;It is not that I have
any particular desire to eat you, but if I do a good deed, I shall get
virtue. However, as you are good enough to insist, I am willing to make
a meal of you.&rdquo; So saying, he put his tail into the marsh, and
the monkey, catching hold of it, was slowly dragged forth. On which the
monkey said, &ldquo;Now let me dry myself in the sun, and when the mud
is dry you can scrape it off and eat me.&rdquo; So he sat in the sun,
and the tiger waited hungrily. But the monkey seized the opportunity
when the tiger chanced to look another way, and clambered up a tree. At
that the tiger was very angry, and waited two or three days at the foot
of the tree. Finally he pretended to die of starvation and lay there
with his mouth open and his great teeth showing. So the monkey climbed
down, slowly and cautiously. And the tiger lay quite still, so that the
flies came and buzzed in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>mouth. And first the monkey
carefully put his tail in the tiger&rsquo;s mouth. But he never
stirred. Then the monkey thrust his leg in the tiger&rsquo;s mouth, and
still he did not move. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the monkey, in great
glee, &ldquo;you would have gobbled up my tail, and scrunched up my
limbs, would you?&rdquo; And so saying, the silly creature thrust his
head in the tiger&rsquo;s mouth. And the jaws closed with a scrunch,
and the monkey died, and that&rsquo;s all!</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The story of the merchant lad.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a certain lad whose father died before he
was born. And, one day, when he had grown a big boy, he asked his
mother, &ldquo;What did my father do for his living?&rdquo; And his
mother, drawing a long breath, said, &ldquo;Your father used to travel
about selling things. Ah, if he were alive we should have no trouble to
endure!&rdquo; But the boy replied, &ldquo;Do not you think that I too
could earn money in that way? Bring out what money there is, and let me
see what I can do.&rdquo; But his mother said, &ldquo;Ah, my son, you
must not talk like that! If you go away into foreign lands and die
there, what will become of me?&rdquo; But her son would not listen to
her, and by importunity induced her to give him money, with which he
bought goods, and procured a boat, and hiring two or three men, took
leave of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>his mother, and went into a far country to
trade. Finally he came to a certain place where he moored his boat, at
the place where men draw water, and sent his men to hawk his wares from
village to village while he himself stayed in the boat. It happened
that there lived hard by an old couple who possessed a white swan,
which they fed and tended as though it were their own child. One day,
the lad saw this swan strip itself of its swan plumage and become a
beautiful maiden, and bathe. From that time forth he paid great
attention to the owners of the swan, and gave them presents of the oil
and other things he had in his boat. And when the merchandise had been
sold and the time was come to go home, he went to the old
people&rsquo;s house and offering much money begged them to sell him
their swan. But they were for giving him their swan for nothing. He,
however, feared to commit a sin if he took it as a gift, and, because
it was the old man&rsquo;s property, compelled him to take much money
in exchange for it, and went away.</p>
<p>But when he came home with his boat, behold, the swan remained a
swan, and, for disappointment, the lad pined and wasted away. Seeing
which, his old mother consulted various people, but got no help.
Finally, she went to a certain wise woman, who said, &ldquo;Sister, do
not you understand? Something has happened to him while he was away
trading. You must use a device to find out what it is.&rdquo; To which
the mother replied, &ldquo;Tell me plainly what it is, and you will do
a good deed.&rdquo; So the wise woman gave this advice. &ldquo;Some day
do you direct a maiden to search for lice in his hair. And while she is
doing this, let her pretend to be mightily grieved, and let her ask him
what is the matter. And he will feel flattered and will open out his
heart to her.&rdquo; And the mother did as the wise woman directed her.
The girl she sent wept and snuffled as she tended the lad and said,
&ldquo;Tell me why you pine and grow thin; else I too will give up food
and drink.&rdquo; And so he, heaving a sigh, explained thus:
&ldquo;While I was away trading, I saw the white swan which is in my
boat turn into a maiden. But now she remains a swan, and for her love I
am pining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When her task was done, she told the lad&rsquo;s mother, who sent
word to the wise woman. The wise woman said, &ldquo;Let the girl tell
him that the swan maiden worships her own gods in the dead of night.
Let him pretend to lie asleep, and when she divests herself of her swan
plumage, let him seize it and thrust it into the hearth, and then she
will always remain a girl.&rdquo; The old mother directed the girl
accordingly, and the girl told the lad. One day he mixed ashes and oil
in a vessel, and procured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>a yak&rsquo;s tail, and, when
night was come, he lay down and pretended to be fast asleep. Presently
the swan crept out, and feeling his hands, feet, and body with her
beak, was satisfied that he slept. Then slowly taking off her swan
skin, she became absorbed in the worship of her country&rsquo;s gods.
And the lad seeing his opportunity, grasped the swan plumage and thrust
it into the hearth, so that it was singed, and the smell of the
feathers filled the place. And the maiden, smelling the burning
feathers, cried, &ldquo;What have you done to me? What have you done to
me?&rdquo; So saying, she fell down in a faint and seemed as one dead.
But the lad, taking his vessel of oil, anointed her with it, and fanned
her gently with the yak&rsquo;s tail, till she came to. And so they
married, and begat many sons and daughters, and lived happily ever
after. And that&rsquo;s all!</p>

many other languages). The word reminds me of a little story which
shows the perplexities of bilingual people. A Kach&aacute;ri went to
see his Assamese mother-in-law, who provided food and hospitably said
(in Assamese) &ldquo;<i>Kh&#257;, kh&#257;</i>.&rdquo; On which her
son-in-law, obeying her injunction in Kach&aacute;ri, bound her hand
and foot. Seeing his mistake, she laughed and said, in Kach&aacute;ri,
&ldquo;<i>Z&#257;, z&#257;</i>.&rdquo; On which he, much puzzled, went
